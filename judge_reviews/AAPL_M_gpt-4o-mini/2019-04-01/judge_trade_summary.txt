=== Judge's Evaluation: AAPL - Market Data Until 2019-04-01 ===

Based on the provided market data and news, predict the LLM’s decision:
News Factors Considered:
['There have been two major themes arguably helping to boost stocks this year: A dovish Fed and increasing optimism about a U.S.-China trade deal.\n\nWith little news on the latter front this morning, focus could turn toward the Fed, which begins its two-day policy meeting today. With the central bank widely expected to hold rates steady this week, that leaves Fed watchers to anticipate whether policy makers will telegraph more thinking on a potential rate trajectory with a change to its dot plot. \n\nAnother thing the market seems likely to watch for is any new insight into the Fed\'s balance sheet plans, as a slowdown or halt to its bond reduction program could be one way for the Fed to try to give the economy a lift without taking the more dramatic step of lowering rates. The meeting concludes tomorrow, followed by a press conference from Fed Chair Jerome Powell.\n\nStocks appeared ready to resume rallying early Tuesday, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average ($DJI) going for a five-day winning streak even with the fact that **Boeing Co  **(NYSE:BA) has shaved about 400 points off the $DJI since the company\'s troubles started last week. BA shares were down just a touch in pre-market trading.\n\n### Between Brexit and Beijing\n\nOn the other front that the market has been closely watching, media reports suggest that a summit between President Trump and President Xi of China might not happen until June, but that news didn\'t appear to have much of a negative impact Monday. Maybe as long as the two sides are talking and tariffs aren\'t moving higher, some investors might be willing to forgive delays. \n\nMarkets in Asia were mostly lower early Tuesday in slow trading.\n\nIn other overseas news, the Brexit situation might be worth keeping an eye for its potential effects on European markets and the euro\'s relationship to the dollar as more news potentially comes down the pike. The latest reports make it look like there might be a long delay in Brexit. They\'re going to play the stall game, it appears, and that might be one factor helping buttress European shares early Tuesday.\n\nU.S. stocks might be getting some support from a weaker dollar, as the Dollar Index fell again Monday and remained below recent highs. \n\nOne thing that might be holding the Fed back could be low rates overseas. The German bund yield is under 0.1%, compared with U.S. 10-year yields that finished just above 2.6% on Monday. That\'s a pretty wide divergence. \n\n### Checking Resistance Levels\n\nThe S&P 500 (SPX) rose again Monday but closed just short of clearing a resistance area between 2831 and 2834, finishing right in the middle of that band. A push above that to close higher on Tuesday, if it happens, might be viewed as a sign of technical strength.\n\nMeanwhile, the Dow Jones Industrial Average ($DJI) has a four-session win streak going. But with Boeing still under pressure, the $DJI again under-performed the SPX on Monday. \n\nSome analysts say follow-through buying from Friday\'s rally appeared to be a factor Monday on a day when fresh news catalysts were a bit lacking.\n\n### Cyclicals Led Wall Street To Start Week\n\nFrom a sector perspective, cyclicals shined Monday, which is sometimes seen as a potential sign of underlying investor confidence. Some of the leading sectors included Energy, Financials, Consumer Discretionary, and Industrials.\n\nOne sector that didn\'t do so well was Communication Services, which got weighed on in part by weakness in **Facebook, Inc.  **(NASDAQ:FB). That company\'s stock had its worst day of the year, falling more than 3% amid concern about executive departures and an analyst downgrade. However, the FB softness didn\'t extend much to the other FAANGs, as three of the other four rose. **Amazon.com, Inc.  **(NASDAQ:AMZN) and **Apple Inc  **(NASDAQ:AAPL) - which has been on a roll - were particularly strong. \n\nThe analyst downgrading FB warned of strategic, regulatory and brand risks, Briefing.com noted.\n\nSpeaking of downgrades, **JPMorgan Chase & Co** (NYSE:JPM) downgraded **Yum! Brands, Inc.** (NYSE:YUM), sending that stock lower in pre-market trading. Some of the food brands have done well recently, like **Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.  **(NYSE:CMG) and **McDonald \'s Corp **(NYSE:MCD), so we\'ll see if this is an isolated move or if it spreads.\n\nChipmaker stocks were mostly lower Monday ahead of **Micron Technology, Inc.  **(NASDAQ:MU) earnings later this week. Some analysts are worried about falling chip pricing and how that might factor into the company\'s quarter.\n\nSo far this year, the SPX is up just over 13%, while the DJI is up just above 11%. The Nasdaq Composite (up 16.3%) is out-performing both. Meanwhile, volatility, as measured by VIX, rose just slightly on Monday but remains near 2019 lows just above 13.\n\n### Crude Jumps\n\nU.S. crude prices hit a four-month high and are threatening $60 a barrel after OPEC canceled its April meeting and Saudi Arabia said output cuts might extend into the second half of the year, according to media reports. Crude struggled a bit late last week amid economic fears, but anyone who was hoping OPEC might turn up the spigot or even say a few bearish words at the April meeting was probably disappointed with Monday\'s events.\n\nOne question is whether rising oil prices might start to have an impact on commodity-sensitive stocks. Energy stocks performed well on Monday, which might stand to reason, but so far the higher crude costs haven\'t seemed to hurt transportation-related companies. The Dow Jones Transportation Average ($DJT) rose Monday. That index has been recovering the last week after a long slide in early March. This could reflect consumer health.\n\n**Yielding Less** : The yield on the 10-year Treasury has been moving lower in recent sessions. Part of that may be because foreign investors might be piling into U.S. Treasuries to get better yields than they can get at home, boosting Treasury prices, which move inversely to yields. Data Source: Cboe. Chart source: The thinkorswim® platform from TD Ameritrade. _For illustrative purposes only. Past performance does not guarantee future results._\n\n**Fed Funds Futures** : Investors appear to see more of a chance for declining rates than rising ones. While the CME futures market, as of Monday, put chances of any rate move this week at less than 2%, the market shows no chance of a hike at the June meeting and a nearly 15% chance of a rate cut by that time. Looking farther ahead, the futures market sees more than a 25% chance of rates being lower than they are now by the end of the year, and zero chance of them being higher. That\'s quite a turn-around from late last year, when historic data shows the futures market was pricing in around a 40% chance of at least one rate hike in 2019.\n\n**Silver Linings** : If we end up seeing strong earnings from **FedEx Corporation  **(NYSE:FDX) after the close today and **Nike Inc  **(NYSE:NKE) later in the week, it could help to back up what some of the economic data have been telling investors about U.S. consumers being in good shape. It appears consumers are out continuing to spend money and help keep the economy going. That may be a counterpoint to worries about slowing economic growth. True, GDP forecasts have been trimmed and clouds continue hanging over the global trade situation. But it\'s not all doom and gloom. Though the February jobs report was disappointing, many analysts are writing it off to some extent due to cold weather that month and the lingering effects of the government shutdown. Other data, including last Friday\'s better-than-expected March University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment report and last week\'s January retail sales report, arguably could serve as counterweights to the weak jobs data. \n\n**Affordability Still An Issue** : While mortgage rates have been falling, overall home affordability continues to be a headwind for the housing market. "Affordability still remains a key concern for builders," the National Association of Home Builders said in a press release Monday. "The skilled worker shortage, lack of buildable lots and stiff zoning restrictions in many major metro markets are among the challenges builders face as they strive to construct homes that can sell at affordable price points." However, more builders are reporting that lower-priced houses are selling well, echoing the data in the new home sales report last week. A report on February existing home sales is due out later this week. It might be interesting to see if a drop in borrowing costs has given consumers new appetite for home buying as mortgage rates have generally been declining since late last year.\n\n_Information from TDA is not intended to be investment advice or construed as a recommendation or endorsement of any particular investment or investment strategy, and is for illustrative purposes only.

Netflix doesn\'t want to "get too distracted" with what its competitors are doing but still wants to "learn lessons" from any of their missteps.\n\nOther media content makers that already offer a streaming platform like **CBS Corporation** (NYSE:CBS) may sell their content to be included in Apple\'s platform.\n\n### Why It\'s Important\n\nNetflix is up against an "amazing, large, well-funded" company in Apple with "very significant efforts," Hastings said. The company will likely "come up with some great ideas" the executive says will have him "envious."\n\nConsumers may end up the ultimate winner though as new competition helps create "a better industry," CNBC also quoted him as saying.\n\n### What\'s Next\n\nHastings also fielded questions related to its ambitions to enter the Chinese market. The CEO said he expects Netflix and other U.S.-based technology companies to be blocked in China "for a long time."\n\nNetflix traded higher by 1 percent to $367.26 at time of publication.\n\n_Related Links:_\n\n_Analyst: Video Service Highlights Apple\'s \'Law Of Large Numbers Problem\'_\n\n_Apple\'s Streaming Ambition Could Result In Disney CEO Iger Resigning From iPhone Maker\'s Board_\n\n_Photo courtesy of Netflix._'
 '**Netflix, Inc.** (NASDAQ:NFLX) is off to another hot start to 2019, and one analyst expects that bullish momentum to continue.\n\n### The Analyst\n\nRBC analyst Mark Mahaney reiterated his Outperform rating and $480 price target for Netflix.\n\n### The Thesis\n\nIn a Wedneday note, Mahaney discussed four reasons he\'s still bullish on Netflix\'s stock.\n\nFirst, RBC\'s March survey of U.S. users suggested mixed to positive trends for the month. Those trends included a record penetration rate of 65 percent, a consistent customer satisfaction rate of 67 percent and a slight increase in churn, with 11.6 percent of users indicating they are likely to cancel subscriptions.\n\n"We interpret these results as mixed-to-positive... all in the midst of a material price increase," Mahaney wrote in the note.\n\nSecond, RBC got extremely strong survey results from the Japan market, a key international growth source for Netflix. Those numbers including a penetration rate of 11 percent, double the 5 percent penetration rate RBC found a year ago. In addition, 69 percent of customers report being satisfied with the platform, an even higher rate than in the U.S.\n\nThird, while competition is heating up in over-the-top video streaming thanks to **Apple, Inc.** (NASDAQ:AAPL), **Walt Disney Co.** (NYSE:DIS) and other entrants, Mahaney sees increasing evidence the market for streaming video will be so big that a handful of companies can thrive.\n\n"Tho the landscape appears more challenging, based on what we have seen from survey work and commentary from leading Internet & Media management teams, we believe there is a massive opportunity facing Internet TV that will be able to support 2 or 3 providers, and that Netflix - based on its scale, brand, and value proposition - will be one of those," Mahaney said.\n\nFinally, there has been no material change to RBC\'s bullish five-year outlook for Netflix\'s business. The firm is projecting Netflix will reach 290 million global subscribers by 2023 and and will reach operating margins of 25 to 30 percent and annual EPS of between $19 and $26.\n\n### Price Action\n\nNetflix traded higher by 1.25 percent at $363.26 per share Wednesday morning.\n\n_Related Links:_\n\n_Analyst: Video Service Highlights Apple\'s \'Law Of Large Numbers Problem\' _\n\n_Do You Love Cult Stocks?_\n\nFor a while, **Alphabet Inc**(NASDAQ:GOOGL) (NASDAQ:GOOG) was content with its Google Maps Easter Egg games. Now, it\'s ready for the big leagues.\n\nManagement announced Tuesday it will break into video games with a new streaming service, gaming hardware and content. Analysts are thrilled.\n\nBank of America Merrill Lynch analysts Justin Post and Benjamin Sherlund maintained a Buy rating and $1,350 price target on Alphabet. KeyBanc Capital Markets analysts Evan Wingren and Andy Hargreaves maintained an Overweight rating and $1,430 target, while Tigress Financial managing partner Ivan Feinseth recommends purchase.\n\n### **The Theses**\n\nGoogle\'s "Stadia" streaming service will live in the company cloud, open in Chrome or Chromecast, and require no console or download to play. While Google will market Stadia controllers, the system will be compatible with any device and third-party controller.\n\nThe service, slated for launch in 2019, is seen to be a boon for both publishers and Google.\n\n"By offering a platform to gamers without the high barriers of entry of traditional gaming (expensive PCs or consoles), Google may expand the gaming market for AAA content (mobile market has over 2 billion players)," Post and Sherlund wrote in a note. "With YouTube being the \'lobby\' for game access and Stadia offering the ability push to connect to games from YouTube, Stadia could be a tailwind to YouTube engagement and monetization."\n\nFeinseth agreed that YouTube integration yields significant growth and upside opportunities.\n\nAnalysts anticipate competition from **Microsoft Corporation**(NASDAQ:MSFT), which is already established in the content and console space, as well as **Amazon.com, Inc.** (NASDAQ:AMZN) and **Apple Inc.** (NASDAQ:AAPL).\n\n### **Roll-Out Hold-Ups**\n\nKeyBanc also suspects internet mechanics may prove inhibitive in the near term.\n\n"Although we came away very impressed by the rollout, we believe internet speed could remain a material bottleneck for global adoption," Wingren and Hargreaves wrote.\n\nBank of America Merrill Lynch noted that, if latency issues are overcome, Google stands to reap big rewards.\n\n"If the service can launch with low latency as expected, we think Stadia will demonstrate the potential power of the Google cloud network in a 5G world (which could power the Internet of Things [IoT] and self-driving autos)," Post and Sherlund wrote. "Investors could, in turn, be more optimistic on capex investments."\n\n### **Secondary Effects**\n\nStadia could remove barriers to the gaming industry as it cuts consumer costs, download time, and hardware or connectivity limitations.\n\n"If Google can deliver on its promises, this technology has the potential to be highly disruptive; it is promising an ambitious service that can deliver 4K (and even 8K) gaming at scale globally that is ubiquitous and cross platform with low latency," Wingren and Hargreaves wrote. "This is the holy grail for game makers."\n\nIt is seen to expand the total addressable market for publishers like **Activision Blizzard, Inc.** (NASDAQ:ATVI), **Electronic Arts Inc.** (NASDAQ:EA) and **Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc.**(NASDAQ:TTWO).\n\n"By moving the compute power to the network, Google would help to accelerate the streaming transition, open up gaming to new players and allow for more advanced game play such as Battle Royal modes with 1,000s of players which was previously not possible," Post and Sherlund wrote.\n\nAs Google builds its market, Bank of America Merrill Lynch expects publisher collaborations, content licensing deals or acquisitions of content studios.\n\n**Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.**(NASDAQ:AMD) may see more action, too. Google is using custom AMD chips for Stadia services but may see fit to expand the relationship.\n\n"The new AMD/Alphabet partnership creates a significant opportunity for AMD and opens up the possibility that AMD chips could be used in other Alphabet/Google applications," Feinseth wrote.\n\n_Related Links:_\n\n_Battle Royale: Morgan Stanley Cautiously Upbeat On EA, Activision_\n\n_Snap Reportedly Set To Launch Gaming Platform In April_\n\nThere\'s likely going to be a hunt for direction this morning as investors await the Fed\'s latest verdict on the economy and its thoughts on the future direction of interest rates. \n\nIt wouldn\'t be all that surprising to see some slow trade ahead of the Fed meeting. Things are often a little dull on Fed days, though there\'s really not too much drama associated with the Fed\'s decision today the way there was at the December meeting. That was the last time the Fed raised rates, but since then it\'s adopted a dovish pose. Chances of a rate move this afternoon are near zero, according to the futures market. More on the central bank below.\n\nWhile the Fed might be in focus today, it\'s also important not to forget about the trade situation. As a reminder of its importance, consider the earnings report from **FedEx Corporation  **(NYSE:FDX) after yesterday\'s close. The company\'s shares fell more than 6% in pre-market trading this morning after FDX missed Wall Street\'s earnings and revenue projections. FDX also lowered guidance. What was one factor behind the miss?  As the company said in its earnings release, "Slowing international macroeconomic conditions and weaker global trade growth trends continue."\n\nThat sounds like a pretty solid reason to hope for some sort of trade resolution, and not just with China. Remember, the U.S. also has trade issues with Europe, and Congress hasn\'t approved last year\'s revised trade agreement with Canada and Mexico. All this helps create uncertainty for companies like FDX.\n\nMedia reports today suggest that the U.S. and China will continue negotiations next week.\n\nOverseas, the Brexit situation remains a bit confusing. There were reports early today that Prime Minister Theresa May will ask for a three-month delay. That would push the March 29 deadline back until late June, but the idea needs E.U. approval. Overseas stocks were mixed early Wednesday, and crude oil took a step back after approaching $60 a barrel yesterday. It\'s still near four-month highs.\n\n### Will Fed See Things the Market\'s Way?\n\nThere appears to be a dichotomy going into today\'s Fed decision and its release of an updated "dot plot" showing where Fed officials think rates might go in coming years. The last dot plot showed the Fed still penciling in rising rates, but investors now see rates likely falling over the coming months and years, according to futures trading.\n\nThe question is whether the updated dot plot due today might factor in the recent economic slowdown around the world that\'s pushing bond yields lower and also causing the spread between relatively high U.S. yields and very low European yields to widen. The Fed isn\'t expected to make any rate changes today, but Fed Chair Jerome Powell\'s press conference following the 2 p.m. EDT decision, along with the dot plot release, might help investors fill in some of the blanks about the long-term rate picture.\n\nStocks have been on a tear thanks in part to the Fed\'s desire to stay "patient," and watch the data come in. At the same time, U.S. benchmark 10-year Treasury yields are just above 2.6%, back near January lows but still way above the benchmark European yield. Futures prices at the CME show no chance of a rate hike and less than a 2% chance of a rate cut today. By the June meeting, chances of a cut in rates rise to above 9%, and futures factor in about a 22% chance of the Fed cutting rates by year-end.\n\nAs we\'ve also been saying, investors might want to listen this afternoon for any updates on the Fed\'s balance sheet plans. Powell arguably walks a fine line on the balance sheet going into the meeting. A move by the Fed to announce the planned end its balance sheet unwinding, which it has hinted at, might be seen as positive from a market perspective but negative from an economic one. \n\nIt seems like the Fed has spent the last few months preparing investors for possible dovish moves like that, as Powell and others continue to note slowing economic growth. The risk, potentially, would be for the Fed to take this step more quickly than investors had expected. Such a move might be seen as a sign that the economy is worse than investors may have thought.\n\nOn the other hand, lack of action to slow or stop the unwinding could be seen as the Fed getting behind the curve, so to speak.\n\nAlso, we\'ll see if Powell says anything about where he and other Fed officials now see the so-called "neutral" short-term interest rate. That\'s the level where the Fed would see rates not being too tight or too loose. In December, this level ranged between 2.5% and 3.5%, according to Fed officials. The Fed\'s benchmark rate now is between 2.25% and 2.5%. If the neutral level comes down, The Wall Street Journal noted, that could imply that the Fed sees less need for future rate hikes.\n\n### See-Saw Action Tuesday Amid Conflicting Trade Reports\n\nTuesday\'s market looked like a trade tug of war between conflicting reports, with stocks getting pulled back and forth for much of the day amid confusion about progress in U.S./China talks. One media outlet reported difficulties, taking stocks lower, but then another outlet reported the negotiations might be nearing the finish line. With investors apparently unsure about the situation, the market veered toward the flat-line after initially rallying. By the end of the day, the Dow Jones Industrial Average\'s ($DJI) four-day win streak was over.\n\nThe quick downturn after an early rally once again might indicate just how closely the market appears to be following negotiations. A lot of reports lately said the talks could spill over well into June, so the jumpiness probably isn\'t going away anytime soon.\n\nThough **Boeing Co  **(NYSE:BA) got beaten down the last two weeks due to safety concerns, investors might want to also keep in mind that both BA and **Caterpillar Inc  **(NYSE:CAT) have also been seen as barometers of the China situation, since both companies do so much business there. That\'s why it might be important to watch their performance in coming weeks to potentially get some insight into market optimism or pessimism about tariffs. Shares of the two companies were mixed Tuesday, with neither making any steep moves in either direction.\n\nAnother area that could be worth watching for trade sentiment is semiconductors, which have been outpacing the overall market gains since the start of the year. These companies tend to have a higher than typical exposure to the China market. In some ways, one could argue that semiconductor companies have taken the lead so far this year and have helped provide momentum across other parts of the market, kind of the way the FAANGs did last year. \n\nOne big gainer in the chip space Tuesday was **Nvidia Corporation  **(NASDAQ:NVDA), up more than 6% as the company hosted a tech conference that included product announcements. Another was **Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.** (NASDAQ:AMD), which rose 11% after news reports that AMD would partner with Google on a game streaming platform.\n\n### Preparing for the Worst?\n\nIf things start to look sketchy on the China negotiations, that might be picked up in some of the stocks that typically are seen as having less China exposure, including Utilities, Real Estate, and Consumer Staples. Strength in the Treasury market or a rise in the VIX (the market\'s most closely watched volatility indicator) might also indicate investor concerns about the China situation.\n\nSpeaking of Treasuries, yields remained pretty muted Tuesday as the Fed gathered. The 10-year yield was at around 2.6% early Wednesday, while the two-year was at 2.46%. That spread is sometimes watched, because a flat or an inverted curve--in which the longer-term Treasury yield falls below the shorter-term yield--has sometimes been associated with receptions. That spread fell to single-digits late last year, but has been pretty steady in the teens for weeks.\n\nOn the data front, investors might want to stay tuned Thursday for February leading indicators and the March Philadelphia Fed Index. Factory orders for January rose just 0.1%, a bit below Wall Street\'s consensus. Like other reports from that month, it might be helpful to take that one with a grain of salt due to the government shutdown and bad weather.\n\n**Financials Rally Into Fed** : The Financial sector (candlestick) had a rough day Tuesday, but has rallied from recent lows going into the Fed meeting. Part of the strength could stem from thoughts that low rates might raise loan demand. However, Info Tech (purple line) is up much more sharply over the last month. Data Source: S&P Dow Jones Indices. Chart source: The thinkorswim® platform from TD Ameritrade. _For illustrative purposes only. Past performance does not guarantee future results._\n\n**Deutsche \'s Woes:** This week struggling **Deutsche Bank AG  **(NYSE:DB) said it\'s considering merging with its rival in Commerzbank, a strategy favored by German\'s ministry of finance for several months. In the past year, DB\'s shares have plunged more than 40% as it undergoes a restructuring plan that includes significant job cuts. The German lender has been riddled with setbacks since the financial crisis of 2008, including facing billions fines over issues like its role in toxic mortgage assets, a money-laundering scheme and interest rate manipulation. In Q4, Deutsche reported a net loss that fell short of estimates, although it reported its first full-year profit since 2014. Some third-party analysts say a merger with Commerzbank would help Deutsche and the German banking system recover, but others aren\'t so sure. \n\n**Apple Event Looming?:** Technology giant **Apple Inc.  **(NASDAQ:AAPL) is reportedly gearing up to announce a new media and entertainment service at an event scheduled for early next week, according to Bloomberg. It appears to analysts that AAPL is trying to lean on service-type revenue as its revenue from iPhones has been a bit lackluster, down 15% in the company\'s fiscal Q1. Its video streaming service is expected to include free original content and paid subscription options for content from companies like Starz and Showtime. While AAPL\'s plans for new services are attracting attention, it\'s not giving up on hardware efforts. AAPL just rolled out an update to its iMac desktop that includes faster processors and new graphics chips. It also revamped its iPad mini and iPad Air.\n\n**\' Tis the Season--for IPOs**: With the start of spring, initial public offerings (IPOs) seem to be in the air along with the chirping of robins and the sound of baseballs hitting the bat. Some of the companies that might launch IPOs soon include popular technology and customer service firms, so the names are likely to be familiar to many. However, investors should consider keeping a cautious outlook. How many times in recent years have we seen a stock have an IPO with a lot of publicity, only to crater soon after opening day? Sometimes people confuse a company and a business. You may love the product, but that doesn\'t necessarily mean you have to love the stock, too. \n\nThe problem with IPOs is that many people rush in with both hands, but it might be worth waiting to see what the stocks do. Or, if you do jump on an IPO, you might want to consider only buying shares in partial increments and not going all in at once. People are excited to invest in these companies, and it\'s exciting that retail investors are getting these opportunities, but they should probably keep the potential downside in mind. People don\'t plan for things going down, and that\'s when they often get into trouble.\n\n_Information from TDA is not intended to be investment advice or construed as a recommendation or endorsement of any particular investment or investment strategy, and is for illustrative purposes only.

 'The **Invesco QQQ**(NASDAQ:QQQ) recently turned 20 years old and today is home to $71.82 billion in assets under management, making it one of the largest U.S.-listed exchange traded funds.\n\nOne of the primary reasons advisors and investors have widely embraced QQQ is because the fund provides efficient access to some of the largest Internet and technology names.\n\n### What To Know\n\nWhile there is no denying that large-cap Internet and technology names, such as **Alphabet Inc.** (NASDAQ:GOOG), **Apple Inc.** (NASDAQ:AAPL) and **Microsoft Corp.** (NASDAQ:MSFT), rally, QQQ follows suit, there are other compelling options for accessing the Nasdaq-100 Index.\n\nWith the Nasdaq-100 Equal-Weight Index hitting another record high Wednesday, the **Direxion NASDAQ-100 Equal Weighted Index Shares**(NYSE:QQQE) reminds investors that equally weighting the Nasdaq-100 Index can pay off.\n\n### Why It\'s Important\n\nYear to date, the equal-weight QQQE is up 17.63 percent, topping the cap-weighted Nasdaq-100 Index by about 155 basis points. Due to the dominance of stocks such as Microsoft, Apple and **Amazon.com** (NASDAQ:AMZN) in the cap-weighted Nasdaq-100, there are times when that index will beat its equal-weight counterpart. Conversely, there are also periods when the equal-index will top its cap-weighted rival.\n\nSome of the benefits using QQQE as an alternative to the cap-weighted Nasdaq-100 are reducing concentration risk and potentially lowering downside capture when technology stocks falter.\n\nThe cap-weighted Nasdaq-100 allocates about 43 percent of its weight to the technology sector. While that\'s well of the high of 78 percent in 2000, that\'s still more than double the S&P 500\'s weight to that sector. QQQE\'s tech weight is higher compared to the S&P 500, but at 37.27 percent, it\'s well below that of the cap-weighted Nasdaq-100.\n\nQQQE is also under weight communication services stocks by nearly 900 basis points compared to the cap-weighted Nasdaq-100, reducing the Direxion fund\'s vulnerabilities to downside in stocks such as Alphabet and **Facebook Inc.**(NASDAQ:FB).\n\n### What\'s Next\n\nNo one knows what\'s next for QQQE, but with the Nasdaq-100 racing higher, the fund could be increasingly appealing for investors looking to capture some of that upside while not being highly exposed to a small number of stocks.\n\n_Related Links_\n\n_A New Fintech ETF_\n\n_Different Looks At Chip ETFs_\n\n_Photo credit:bfishadow, Flickr_\n\nWhen **Apple Inc.**(NASDAQ:AAPL) struggles with the iPhone, suppliers like **Qorvo Inc**(NASDAQ:QRVO) suffer along with Cupertino. Yet an analyst at Goldman Sachs thinks the time is ripe to buy Qorvo stock.\n\n### The Analyst\n\nAnalyst Toshiya Hari upgraded Qorvo from Neutral to Buy and hiked the price target from $66 to $79, representing 14-percent upside potential.\n\n### The Thesis\n\nThe risk-reward on  Qorvo  is skewed positive given the scope for upward revisions to EPS estimates over the next 12-24 months, Hari said in the Wednesday upgrade note. \n\nGoldman\'s Buy rating is an "out-of-consensus" call, as 58 percent of Qorvo analysts have Neutral ratings and 4 percent have Sell ratings, the analyst said. \n\n"The risk is we are a quarter early in making this call," Hari said. \n\nHari named the following reasons for his constructive view on  Qorvo: \n\nThe smartphone market is showing early signs of stabilization in units, as near-term upside in China likely offsets marginal weakness at Apple.\n\n5G infrastructure is showing strength; Goldman\'s recent checks at the Mobile World Congress suggest the strength is sustainable through 2020-2021. Qorvo\'s base station accounted for about 30 percent of Infrastructure and defense products segment sales, which constitute about 10 percent of total sales.\n\nGoldman sees margin expansion opportunity given the company\'s guidance for a 47-percent non-GAAP gross margin for the March quarter, 170 basis points below consensus. Margins are likely to expand over the next 12-24 months due to ongoing restructuring initiatives and other cost-cutting initiatives, along with a better business mix from above-average growth in the IDP business, Hari said. \n\nFree cash flow generation is likely to improve further in fiscal 2020-2021 due to anticipated operating margin improvement, disciplined working capital management and reduced capex intensity.\n\nGoldman sees the current valuation as compelling, as it underappreciates the top- and bottom-line growth potential of the company.\n\n### The Price Action\n\nQorvo shares were rallying 4.79 percent to $72.43 at the time of publication Thursday. \n\n_Related Links:_\n\n_Najarian Brothers See Unusual Options Activity In Qorvo, Zynga, IQIYI_\n\n_Should You Buy The Skyworks Dip?

Management is likely to include content partners and the company will maintain a 25-35 percent fee of cut of monthly subscriber fees. Apple\'s original content remains in production with high-profile Hollywood superstars, including Oprah Winfrey, Steven Spielberg, Jennifer Aniston and Reese Witherspoon.\n\nMonday\'s announcement will likely prove to be the "tip of the iceberg" for a much larger streaming content strategy, Ives said. This may prove to be a large catalyst to Apple\'s services growth business, which remains a "wild card" in driving the stock\'s valuation. In fact, Apple\'s new business could generate revenue of more than $50 billion by fiscal 2020 even though it\'s years behind in the "content arms race."\n\nApple\'s strategy of avoiding large scale M&A deals is widely known but this could change in the streaming video space. The process of creating a large library of original content is a "slow and arduous path," according to Ives, but being aggressive in acquiring content makers creates a realistic goal of hitting 100 million subscribers within three to five years.\n\n### Price Action\n\nShares of Apple were trading higher around $187 Thursday morning.\n\n_Related Links:_\n\n_Apple\'s Streaming Ambition Could Result In Disney CEO Iger Resigning From iPhone Maker\'s Board_\n\n_Netflix CEO Says Company Decided\'Not To Integrate \' With Apple_'
 'After holding its viewership data cards close to its chest, **Netflix** (NASDAQ:NFLX) revealed some interesting numbers regarding some of its content.\n\nRomantic comedies were at the top of the Netflix best list for 2018, the company said in a December press release. The most-watched and rewatched movies included "Roxanne Roxanne," "To All the Boys I\'ve Loved Before" and "The Kissing Booth."\n\nFor its list of most-loved actors from 2018, Netflix rates these by increases in Instagram followers.\n\nTopping the list was the "New Queer Eye" (all five actors), followed by Lana Condor from "All the Boys I\'ve Loved Before" and Joel Courtney from "The Kissing Booth."\n\nThe Netflix show "You" enjoyed a huge debut after a very drab showing on the Lifetime Channel. The same can be said for the series "Sex Education," and the feature movie "The Bird Box" is on pace to acquire 80 million household viewers.\n\nNielsen measures limited viewer numbers for the streaming service. These numbers reflect TV viewing in the U.S. only and do not include other devices or other countries.\n\n### Why It\'s Important\n\nThe streaming service has been secretive about its viewing data up until recently, and these few insights do not qualify as a deep dive behind the curtain of the streaming giant.\n\nIn 2017, Netflix members watched more than 140 million hours per day, and TechCrunch suggested the reported number of hours viewed may have decreased in 2018 relative to previous years.\n\nAt the end of 2015, Netflix announced that its 74.7 million users had watched 42.5 billion hours of content. Those numbers translated into 570 million hours per year per account compared to 480 million hours per account this year.\n\nNetflix has more than 100 million users now and included only its original content in the counting this year -- which may explain the drop in numbers.\n\n### What\'s Next\n\nThe series "House of Cards" was just the beginning: now "Stranger Things" and other popular Netflix series have become water cooler banter. \n\nIn order to continue growing for its investors, Netflix is counting on non-subscribers joining the masses. \n\nAt the recent INTV Conference, Cindy Holland, Netflix\'s VP for original content, revealed that the average subscriber watches two hours of Netflix every day, according to Variety. \n\nWhen asked to comment on competition from **Apple Inc.** (NASDAQ:AAPL), **Amazon.com, Inc.**(NASDAQ:AMZN) and **Walt Disney Co**(NYSE:DIS), Holland said the challenge for any newcomer is to grow in the future.\n\n"We\'re very different from the large tech companies like Google and Facebook," Variety quoted Holland as saying. "We have a different business model [and we\'re] much closer to cable TV." \n\nHolland said Netflix is focused on increasing its international output, citing "Narcos" as a global success. Netflix is established in 190 countries and now makes more than 80 percent of its acquisitions outside the U.S.\n\n_Related Links:  _\n\n_JPMorgan Says Apple Should Go After Netflix, Sonos Or Activision _\n\n_Cramer Breaks Down Investing In Streaming Video: Content Is King _\n\n_This weekend \'s Barron\'s features stories focused on activist investor strategies._\n\n_See how some notable activist efforts have fared and whether they truly create value._\n\n_And find out how ordinary investors can profit from taking an activist \'s approach._\n\nThis weekend\'s Barron\'s features stories focused on the strategies of activist investors.

 '**Apple Inc.**(NASDAQ:AAPL) will offer gamers more than 100 exclusive games across multiple platforms as part of its new Apple Arcade, which it says is the first subscription games service.\n\nDuring a massive roll-out of various services on Monday that mostly involved offering customers ways to access entertainment through one-stop subscriptions, Apple touted the simplicity of buying games through one service, and also its plans to work with game developers on new offerings.\n\n"With a single subscription you\'ll get access to over 100 new and exclusive games," Apple\'s Ann Thai said at the event in Cupertino, California. "And we\'re just curating them, we\'re backing their development."\n\n### Not Streaming\n\nThe games aren\'t part of a streaming service, like those offered by **Alphabet Inc.** (NASDAQ:GOOGL)\'s Google\'s new Stadia streaming gaming service. Instead, Apple\'s games, which will be exclusive to users of the Apple service, will be available for users to download from the App Store. What\'s new is that once a user has paid the subscription fee, they\'ll have access to all the games. They\'ll have the opportunity to try games without risk, and games will be available offline.\n\nApple hasn\'t said what the fee will be.\n\n"Because subscribers can play Apple Arcade games across iPhone, iPad, Mac and Apple TV, they can pick up where they left off in a game, even if they switch devices," the company said in a press release.\n\nApple Arcade will launch this fall.\n\n**Gaming Stocks**\n\nApple\'s stock closed down 1.2 percent at $188.74. Shares of several gaming stocks ticked lower during the event but eventually recovered.\n\nShares of **Electronic Arts Inc.** (NASDAQ:EA) were off 0.6 percent to close at $101.73, while **Take-Two Interactive Software Inc.** (NASDAQ:TTWO) saw its shares down fractionally to $96.03. Shares of **Activision Blizzard** (NASDAQ:ATVI) closed at $46.98, while shares of **Sony Corp.**(NYSE:SNE) closed at $42.15.\n\n_Related Links:_\n\n_Apple Rolls Out Streaming Service Apple TV+, TV Channels_\n\n_Global Game Spending Returns To Growth, Led By EA Titles, Mobile_\n\n**Apple Inc.**(NASDAQ:AAPL) rolled out its much-awaited video streaming move with Apple TV+ and Apple TV Channels on Monday, along with other expanded services for delivering games and news articles for subscribers for single monthly fees.\n\nApple is seeking to be the go-to place for TV and movie watchers, gamers and news readers - eventually seen by many as a competitor with**Netflix, Inc.** (NASDAQ:NFLX) for TV and movie viewers while trying to replicate that model by also offering a one-stop shop for games and news. \n\nIn a star-studded roll-out that included Steven Spielberg, Oprah Winfrey and Steve Carell, among others, Apple CEO Tim Cook rolled out an expanded vision for Apple as an entertainment and information service provider rather than just a producer of computers and phones.\n\n### Apple TV Plus and Apple TV Channels\n\nApple TV+ will include original Apple programming - as Netflix has done, with a library of original content hinted at by the stars who were at the Apple rollout.\n\nSpielberg announced he will work on a TV series called "Amazing Stories" for Apple TV+, while Reese Witherspoon, Jennifer Aniston and Steve Carell were shown off as the hosts of a new morning show.\n\nApple also is creating a digital entertainment hub where users can bundle their various subscriptions. The app will let users pay for other streaming services, including HBO, Showtime and others, through the Apple app. That part of Apple\'s service is called Apple Channels.\n\n"This is how TV should work," said Apple\'s Peter Stern. "Now it does with Apple Channels.... No more bouncing around from app to app."\n\nNetflix won\'t be a part of that. Netflix CEO Reed Hastings said recently it\'s choosing not to integrate its streaming service with Apple\'s as part of an effort to keep control of Netflix users\' experience. The Apple TV app, already available on iPads, iPhones, will also be available on Macs and various smart TVs, as well as **Roku Inc**(NASDAQ:ROKU) and **Amazon.com, Inc.** (NASDAQ:AMZN) Fire TV devices.\n\n_See Also:Raymond James Says Apple\'s Streaming Plans Are \'More Incremental Than Revolutionary,\' Which Is A Good Thing For Netflix_\n\n### Move To Services\n\nCook noted the iconic tech company has long delivered services like its mapping and music services along with its better-known hardware products like computers and smartphones. But the company is shifting heavily toward services as sales of the company\'s signature product, the iPhone have hit a plateau.\n\nApple products like the iPhone aren\'t becoming obsolete - in fact some analysts see the move as a new way for the Cupertino, Calif.-based Apple to earn money from its iPhone user base, which is closing in on 1 billion customers worldwide. But Apple is transitioning more to a content delivery company.\n\n### Apple Arcade\n\nApple also announced its subscription game service called Apple Arcade. The service won\'t allow streaming play, but is more like a subscription service for games that can be downloaded from the App Store. Subscribers will also be able to try out games.\n\nCook announced that more than 1 billion gamers have downloaded games from the App Store.\n\n_See Also:  What To Know About Apple News+, The Tech Giant\'s News Subscription Service_\n\n### Apple News+\n\nApple also announced a new $9.99 per month subscription service called Apple News + that will give users access to articles from more than 300 newspapers and magazines. It starts this month and is free for the first month.\n\nApple said magazines including National Geographic, The New Yorker and Wired will be included, along with newspapers including the Los Angeles Times and the Wall Street Journal.\n\nCook and other Apple officials touted privacy throughout the presentation, including with the news service. The company said it won\'t let advertisers track Apple News+ users.\n\n### Apple Card\n\nApple also rolled out changes to its credit-card like online payment service with an expansion of its popular Apple Pay service to be called Apple Card. It allows people to pay for products using personal devices with an online credit card. The service is in partnership with **Goldman Sachs** (NYSE:GS) and **Mastercard**(NYSE:MS), which will create widespread acceptance, the company says.\n\n**Price Action**\n\nApple\'s stock was down 1.9 percent after the presentation to $187.33 per share.\n\n**Apple Inc.**(NASDAQ:AAPL) announced Monday it\'s expanding its Apple News service to include access to more than 300 magazines.\n\nThe announcement came at an event at Apple\'s Cupertino, California headquarters where it was also expected to later announce the new Apple streaming service.\n\nAmong the magazines included will be The Atlantic, The New Yorker and Esquire.\n\nApple News+ will also include access to the Los Angeles Times and The Wall Street Journal.\n\nSubscribers to Apple\'s news service will pay one single monthly fee of $9.99 for the publications. The company said subscriptions to each magazine individually would cost more than $8,000.\n\nApple News Plus was available Monday - and the company said the first month would be free.\n\n### **\' Curated By Editors\'**\n\nIn a veiled reference to scandals over social media spreading fake news, Apple CEO Tim Cook noted that the service will be "curated by editors," who will choose stories based on publishers\' reputation rather than propensity for clicks.\n\n"This is going to take Apple News to a whole new level," said Cook.\n\nThe move comes as Apple seeks to shift more toward services, including streaming, seen as critical in the face of a plateau in sales of the company\'s signature product, the iPhone.\n\n"For decades Apple has been creating world class hardware and world-class software," said Tim Cook in a presentation at the Steve Jobs Theater in Cupertino. "We\'ve also been creating world-class services. That is what today is all about."\n\nShares of Apple were down 1.1 percent to $188.81 at time of publication.\n\n_Related Links:_\n\n_What Everybody Is Saying Ahead Of Apple\'s Streaming Video Event_\n\n_Raymond James Says Apple\'s Streaming Plans Are \'More Incremental Than Revolutionary,\' Which Is A Good Thing For Netflix_\n\n**Apple Inc.** (NASDAQ:AAPL) is expected to detail Monday its streaming video plans that will likely pose minimal risk to **Netflix, Inc.** (NASDAQ:NFLX), according to Raymond James.\n\n### The Analyst\n\nRaymond James\' Justin Patterson maintains a Strong Buy rating on Netflix with an unchanged $470 price target.\n\n### The Thesis\n\nIf recent reports are accurate, Apple\'s streaming video ambitions will focus more on selling users a subscription package to other platforms like HBO with a modest focus on its own original content, Patterson said in a research report. Similar services already exist which implies Apple\'s new platform is "more incremental than revolutionary" and a new platform won\'t move the needle in any meaningful way.\n\nMeanwhile, Patterson said box office trends (excluding "Captain Marvel" and "Us") remain "uninspiring" in contrast to Netflix\'s original content which continues to trend well. Specifically, median IMDB reviews are up 44 percent from last year, which implies movie-goers are interested in what Netflix has to offer.\n\nAlthough Netflix hasn\'t yet produced a mega-hit on the scale of "Black Panther," it\'s moving closer in that direction. In fact, it\'s merely a matter of time before Netflix is able to consistently launch major releases and the action flick "Triple Frontier" serves as an "early positive signal of that occurring."\n\nBottom line, Netflix\'s competitive position "remains durable" and Apple\'s new platform is unlikely to affect its position.\n\n### Price Action\n\nShares of Netflix were trading higher by nearly 1 percent at $364.28 Monday morning.\n\n_Related Links:_\n\n_Netflix By The Numbers_\n\n_What Everybody Is Saying Ahead Of Apple\'s Streaming Video Event_\n\n_Photo courtesy of Netflix._\n\nAhead of **Apple Inc.** (NASDAQ:AAPL)\'s scheduled presentation Monday, BTIG turned more bullish on the stock over the longer term.\n\n### The Analyst\n\nBTIG\'s Walter Piecyk maintains a Buy rating on Apple with a price target lifted from $189 to $220.\n\n### The Thesis\n\nApple\'s event titled "It\'s Show Time" could detail its streaming video ambitions. With the stock up 34 percent since its early January, however, makes it "ripe for a sell-off," Piecyk said in a research report. It\'s likely Apple has little new it can say Monday to "satisfy media skeptics" and the "haters" could claim victory with a near-term sell-off.\n\nPiecyk said some of the criticism directed towards Apple\'s streaming video plans will likely be valid as creating compelling content is expensive and "very different than making phones." But investors should keep in mind Apple is entering the new space with $130 billion in cash, $65 billion of free cash flow per year along with 900 million iPhone users globally.\n\nWhile the multiple financial and user metrics won\'t guarantee success, Apple has hired notable Hollywood A-list talent, including Steven Spielberg, Oprah Winfrey and Kevin Durant, among others. The company is likely to highlight Monday how its early partners are "happy and thriving" and management is willing to spend the necessary cash to be successful.\n\n### Price Action\n\nShares of Apple were trading around $192.48 early Monday morning.\n\n_Related Links:_\n\n_What Everybody Is Saying Ahead Of Apple\'s Streaming Video Event_\n\n_4 Reasons Morgan Stanley Loves Apple_'
 '**Apple Inc.** (NASDAQ:AAPL) held a presentation Monday where management detailed new products and services -- but there may be other more attractive plays in the market for investors outside of the iPhone maker\'s stock. \n\n### Chantico Global\'s Sanchez: Apple Entering Mature Markets\n\nApple will face challenges ahead in its new ventures, since it is "planting flags" in markets that are already "fairly mature," Chantico Global\'s Gina Sanchez said on CNBC\'s "Trading Nation" segment Tuesday. Apple "has to make a pivot" into new ventures, which presents a challenge for Cupertino, she said. \n\nThe company is also making a major selling point of privacy as it pledges not to sell consumer data, Sanchez said. \n\n### Oppenheimer\'s Wald: Premium On Apple-Like Companies\n\nApple\'s presentation comes at a time when its new ventures continue to show encouraging macro tailwinds, said Oppenheimer\'s Ari Wald. It also comes at a time when interest rates across the world signal a potential slowdown in the global economy.\n\nA "premium will continue to be placed" on large-cap, quality companies like Apple, the analyst said. \n\nAside from Apple, **Microsoft Corporation** (NASDAQ:MSFT) traded above its old all-time highs and recently hit a new all-time high of $120.82. What\'s encouraging is that the stock did so in the current "mixed and questionable" environment, he said. \n\n**Amazon.com, Inc.** (NASDAQ:AMZN)\'s stock is proving to be the "most tactical its been in years," Wald said. The stock\'s weekly MACD recently inflected positive from the most oversold condition seen since 2014.\n\n_Related Links:_\n\n_Analyst: Apple\'s New Credit Card Bodes Well For Green Dot_\n\n_Apple Rolls Out Streaming Service Apple TV+, TV Channels_\n\n_Oprah Winfrey at Apple \'s Monday presentation. Courtesy photo. _\n\n**Apple, Inc.** (NASDAQ:AAPL) had one of its most important new service unveilings in recent memory on Monday, giving fans their first glimpse at streaming service Apple TV+, subscription gaming service Apple Arcade and news service Apple News+. Unfortunately for investors, Apple didn\'t disclose several key details, including pricing for Apple TV+, pricing for Apple Arcade, guidance for content spending or any launch dates for the new services.\n\nSeveral Wall Street analysts have weighed in on Apple following the event, many of which were disappointed with the lack of clarity Apple provided. Here\'s a sampling of what they had to say.\n\n### Pricing Is Key\n\nBank of America analyst Wamsi Mohan said that, unfortunately, pricing is key for the streaming video and gaming services.\n\n"As with any subscription service, user adoption depends on the price at which the service is offered, and any bundling of services which Apple may introduce," Mohan wrote in a note.\n\nOppenheimer analyst Andrew Uerkwitz said Apple TV+ pricing is the biggest unanswered question following the event.\n\n"Overall, it appears that Apple\'s new services provide better solutions to solve relatively niche problems in media business and they may prompt existing iOS users to stay more invested in Apple\'s ecosystem," Uerkwitz wrote.\n\nJPMorgan analyst Samik Chatterjee said Apple\'s event provided more breadth than investors expected but less depth.\n\n"Most incremental and differentiated to us appears to be the positioning of Apple Card, while Apple Arcade is also favorably positioned given limited similar services on offer," Chatterjee wrote.\n\n_See Also:What To Know About Apple News+, The Tech Giant\'s News Subscription Service_\n\n### Monetizing User Base\n\nTigress Financial analyst Ivan Feinseth said the new services will help Apple better monetize its massive installed iPhone user base over time.\n\n"I believe upside to the $220 to $240 range exists over the next 12 months and continue to recommend purchase," Feinseth wrote.\n\nUBS analyst Timothy Arcuri said the lack of details was frustrating, but the event marked a clear turning point for Apple.\n\n"While recognizing the potential for the stock to consolidate some of these gains post-announcement, this is also the start of a broader and deeper services narrative - one that comes against a 900MM+ iPhone installed base, ~600MM of which don\'t pay a dime in services," Arcuri wrote.\n\nMorgan Stanley analyst Katy Huberty said Services is the key to the next five years of Apple growth.\n\n"We still believe Apple is likely to bundle hardware/services and/or multiple services over time, with our September 2018 analysis suggesting Apple could generate $22-37B in revenue by 2025 for an Apple Media bundle alone, up from $3.8B in 2018," Huberty wrote.\n\n### No Immediate Impact\n\nCowen analyst Krish Sankar said Wall Street will likely get more bullish on the new services as the details trickle out in coming months.\n\n"We continue to view Services as a LT investable theme and the 3/25 event that introduced the upcoming Apple News+, Arcade, and TV+ subscription offerings suggest a differentiated but gradual approach to establishing future growth vectors," Sankar wrote.\n\nLoup Ventures analyst Gene Munster said Apple\'s new batch of services will add $20 billion in revenue annually by 2023.\n\n"While we are maintaining our estimate of $78B in Services revenue in 2023, the levers to achieving that number are more clear," Munster wrote.\n\nCiti analyst Jim Suva said investors shouldn\'t expect the launches to be a near-term catalyst for the stock because consumers are typically slow to adopt new offerings.\n\n"However, we do see the next catalyst as the upcoming company earnings and capital deployment," Suva wrote.\n\n_See Also:Apple Arcade Is The Company\'s Newest Subscription Gaming Service_\n\n### iPhone Sales In Focus\n\nGoldman Sachs analyst Rod Hall said the markets focus will likely now return to slowing iPhone sales.\n\n"Though all of these services are interesting from a platform churn point of view none seem likely on our calculations to materially impact EPS in the short term, with the possible exception of Apple Arcade pending pricing and service details," Hall wrote.\n\nPiperJaffray analyst Michael Olson said high-margin, highly recurrive subscription Services revenue is Apple\'s solution to stagnating iPhone sales.\n\n"We estimate TTM services revenue per active installed device grew 19% y/y in FY18 and Apple is layering on new services to drive strong growth of this metric for years to come," Olson wrote.\n\nRaymond James analyst Chris Caso said the market will likely see the new services as bullish for Apple, but it\'s unlikely they will have an impact on the company\'s overall numbers anytime soon.\n\n"While details of News+ pricing vary slightly from our initial assumptions - and pricing for updated TV+ services was not provided - we maintain our view that Apple suffers from the law of large numbers, with limited opportunities to offset the longer-term moderation / decline in iPhone sales," Caso wrote.\n\n### Ratings And Price Targets\n\n  * Bank of America has a Buy rating and $210 target.\n  * UBS has a Buy rating and $215 target.\n  * Cowen has an Outperform rating and $220 target.\n  * Raymond James has a Market Perform rating and no target.\n  * Goldman Sachs has a Neutral rating and $140 target.\n  * Oppenheimer has a Perform rating and no target.\n  * Morgan Stanley has an Overweight rating and $220 target.\n  * PiperJaffray has an Overweight rating and $201 target.\n  * JPMorgan has an Overweight rating and $228 target.\n  * Citigroup has a Buy rating and $220 target.\n\n\n\nApple\'s stock traded higher by 1.5 percent to $191.74 per share at time of publication.\n\n_Photo courtesy of Apple._\n\n**Apple Inc.** (NASDAQ:AAPL) will enter the streaming video space and **Netflix, Inc.** (NASDAQ:NFLX) investors have little reason to be concerned, according to Bank Of America.\n\n### The Analyst\n\nBank of America\'s Nat Schindler maintains a Buy rating on Netflix with an unchanged $450 price target.\n\n### The Thesis\n\nApple\'s new streaming video ambitions are meant to be an alternative to traditional cable TV within a highly fragmented market, Schindler said in a research report. As such, a new entrant in the market is unlikely to negatively impact Netflix\'s subscriber growth.\n\nApple boasts 1.4 billion users globally across all devices but this isn\'t enough to guarantee market share. Apple Music has around 50 million subscribers, which is "much less" than **Spotify Technology SA** (NYSE:SPOT). The same scenario is likely to play out on the streaming video space given Netflix\'s revenue represents around 70 percent of the total U.S. subscription streaming video market.\n\nSchindler said the more likely impact from Apple\'s entrance will be felt by smaller and more traditional streaming video companies. These companies have less resources to compete against Apple\'s reported $1-$2 billion investment in content and Netflix\'s content to spend of $8-$9 billion.\n\nBottom line, there\'s little reason to see Apple becoming the "base subscription package for everyday consumers" in the near term although content competition could be a concern over the longer-term.\n\n### Price Action\n\nNetflix\'s stock is trading lower by about 1 percent at $362.37 per share Tuesday morning.\n\n_Related Links:_\n\n_Apple Rolls Out Streaming Service Apple TV+, TV Channels_\n\n_Raymond James Says Apple\'s Streaming Plans Are \'More Incremental Than Revolutionary,\' Which Is A Good Thing For Netflix_\n\n_Photo credit:Matthew Keys, Flickr _\n\nStarting this Spring, transit users in Portland will be able to use Apple Pay to purchase bus and light rail tickets.\n\nMarking a leap forward for mobile transit payments, **Apple Inc**(NASDAQ:AAPL)** ** announced today that Apple Pay will be coming to bus, light rail and subway systems in select U.S. cities later this year. Chicago, Portland (Oregon) and New York City will pioneer the service, which will allow passengers to pay fares with their iPhone instead of paper tickets or transit cards.\n\nApple Pay transit payments are already available in Beijing and Shanghai, and a growing number of cities across the U.S. either use similar systems or are preparing to bring them online. Just last week, Google announced that riders will be able to board the Las Vegas Monorail using Google Pay on Android phones.\n\nIn Portland, the Apple Pay service will integrate with the Hop Fastpass, a payment system designed by Moovel, the Daimler mobility company that has its U.S. headquarters in Portland.\n\nRiders can currently use Apple Pay linked to a debit or credit card, said Roberta Altstadt, a spokesperson for TriMet, Portland\'s regional transit agency. "When the new system comes out," she said, "you will actually add the Hop card into Apple Wallet."\n\nThe Hop Fastpass allows people to accrue benefits each time they ride. Once riders have paid the cost of a monthly pass in rides ($100 for an adult pass), any additional rides are free. Those benefits have been limited to adult fare riders and will be expanded to senior citizen fares when the Apple Pay system comes online this spring, Altstadt said. She did not specify a date.\n\nAn Apple spokesperson did not immediately return requests for comment.\n\nApple\'s announcement builds on a wave of smart phone-based transit payments.\n\nNew York City, for example, is moving away from MetroCards in favor of riders tapping their smart phones at the turnstiles.\n\nThe Los Angeles Metro system is planning a one-stop mobile payment system encompassing bike-share, microtransit, electric vehicle sharing and charging, ride-hailing and parking.\n\nPortland is planning a similar roll out.\n\nImage Sourced From Pixabay\n\nWant more content like this?

These days, it looks like moves in the interest rate complex might be having the same impact.\n\nWith China talks simmering but not sizzling, interest rates now appear to be the main focus. There\'s still an inversion in the Treasury market, with three-month yields slightly higher than 10-year yields, but the 10-year yield narrowed the gap a little early Tuesday and that appeared to put some cheer into the market after Friday and Monday\'s yield-related slide.\n\nThe yield curve inversion has spooked some investors because in the past, inversions often preceded recessions. However, as we often say, past isn\'t always prologue. No one is too good at predicting recessions, and the Fed still expects better than 2% U.S. gross domestic product growth this year. That doesn\'t mean a recession can\'t happen, only that the yield curve inversion isn\'t necessarily proof that one is coming.\n\nAnyone interested in the Treasury market might want to pay attention today as the U.S. Treasury plans to auction $26 billion in 52-week bills and $40 billion in two-year notes. That auction might get watched more closely than usual considering the inversion.\n\nTuesday also brought fresh data in the form of housing starts and building permits for February, and both numbers came in below Wall Street analysts\' estimates. Housing starts were down nearly 9% from the previous month. If you\'re looking for silver lining, January housing starts did get revised upward, but generally the report could continue to raise concerns about demand for new homes.\n\nThe Conference Board\'s March consumer confidence number is also in the works today. The confidence number, which can often shape investors\' thoughts on future consumer spending, was pretty strong last time out, so we\'ll see if that continued into the early spring.\n\nRemember, soft data last week is one reason other than rates that the market stumbled, so this week\'s data batch might get a little more focus than normal to see if the U.S. economy is holding up OK.\n\n**Apple \'s **(NASDAQ:AAPL) big announcement Monday didn\'t appear to help the stock too much, but it\'s had a nice run for a while and maybe this was a "buy the rumor, sell the news" situation. AAPL continues to emphasize services like streaming as it sees iPhone sales apparently cresting, but the issue with services, as we\'ve said before, is that the margins just aren\'t as strong. Shares rose in pre-market trading Tuesday.\n\nIn premarket moves this morning, **Bed Bath & Beyond** (NASDAQ:BBBY) surged more than 20% after a Wall Street Journal report said that three activist investors were planning a proxy fight to replace the company\'s entire board, saying it has been too slow to pivot toward consumers\' online shopping demands. As we\'ve seen over the last few years, retail companies that don\'t successfully make the online move often get punished by the market.\n\n### Technical Safety Net Torn\n\nThe new week started pretty much where the old one left off, with U.S. markets burdened Monday by global growth worries. Though the Dow Jones Industrial Average ($DJI) made a marginal gain Monday, the Nasdaq (COMP) and S&P 500 (SPX) stayed under pressure. The SPX fell below 2800, a key psychological support point. This could conceivably set the market up for a test of the 200-day moving average down around 2755, according to technical analysts.\n\nIn one minor positive note, the Russell 2000 Index (RUT) of small-caps managed to put the brakes on a its skid, but it\'s still down around 6% over the last month (see more below). Sometimes the RUT has been the first index to indicate a change of sentiment, as it was last summer when it started to come off the rails about a month before the SPX lost its footing. Past isn\'t necessarily prologue, however.\n\nInterest rates continue to draw headlines, with the U.S. benchmark 10-year Treasury yield at one point falling Monday to its lowest level since December 2017 and finishing the day near 2.4%. That\'s down from 2.68% at the start of the year and 2019 highs near 2.8%. By early Tuesday, the 10-year had climbed to 2.44%.\n\nAt times like this, it helps to keep an eye on the global economy. Despite the low U.S. rates, they remain well above the zero rate of Germany and the 0.35% rate in France. For now, the U.S. economy, at least judging from the bond market, remains the belle of the ball, so to speak.\n\nTreasury Market--Why Should Stock Investors Care?  \nA lot of investors might wonder why they should care so much about rates if they\'re not trading fixed income. What do rates have to do with the stock market, they might ask. A lot, actually. They can affect multinational U.S. companies in a big way.\n\nWhen the gap between U.S. and overseas yields starts to widen, as it is now even with the pressure on U.S. yields, that often can mean money heading into the dollar. The U.S. Dollar Index lost a touch of ground Monday and traded at around 96.54, which is down from recent highs above 97.50 but well above where it was a year ago when it scraped 90. One thing to consider watching is the path of the Dollar Index from here. It\'s been in a pattern of setting higher lows when it does go down, sometimes a sign of strength. The dollar slide a little early Tuesday, which also might be helping stocks.\n\nA stronger dollar can often pose issues for multinational companies by making their products seem more expensive to foreign customers. Earnings recently from both **Nike Inc  **(NYSE:NKE) and **Tiffany & Co **(NYSE:TIF) might serve as good lessons about the impact of interest rates on companies. Both of these U.S. companies have a big presence overseas, and they arguably could be feeling the impact of a strong dollar to some extent. Earnings season might help provide clues on how widespread the dollar issue is getting.\n\n### Financials Continue to Sag\n\nThe other thing stock market investors often see at times of lower rates is a soft Financial sector, and that continued to be the case early this week. Financials once again were some of the worst performers on Monday as investors continue to seem worried that weak economic growth both here and overseas could hurt the banks\' businesses. Lower rates often mean lower profits for financial institutions (see more below), so it could be very illuminating in mid-April to hear what key bank CEOs have to say about the economy.\n\nThe pendulum has swung really hard against the banks. A year ago, Financial stocks got rewarded at times because there was widespread belief that interest rates were heading up. It was a frustrating sector for many to trade however, with a lot of stop-and-go.\n\nIt\'s been mostly "stop" recently after Financials had a decent start to the year.  The sector is down more than 4% over the last month compared to slight gains for the SPX.\n\nThe scramble toward fixed income and bond proxy-stocks like Real Estate and Utilities continued at the start of the week, but not as fiercely as on Friday. Utilities and Real Estate both rose slightly, while another so-called "defensive" sector, Consumer Staples, fell a bit.\n\nMeanwhile, volatility--which gained dramatically late last week--continued to slip Monday. The VIX ended the day around 16.3, down from highs above 17 on Friday but still well above last week\'s lows of under 13. Looking back, the VIX might have been playing its historic role of being a warning sign for investors. Historically, a low VIX has often signaled weakness in stocks. \n\nOne thing to potentially watch for if VIX stays elevated is any reaction from the "defensive" sectors we discussed higher up. Recall that last fall, when most of the market was cratering and VIX was above 20 for months, a lot of the Consumer Staples stocks actually did pretty well. Sometimes, though not always, stocks in Staples and Utilities can weather volatility better than some other sectors. Conagra (CAG), a well-known Staple, had another strong day Monday. **Colgate-Palmolive** (NYSE:CL) also rose, as did **Procter & Gamble Co** (NYSE:PG).\n\n**SMALL FRIED** : It\'s been a rough month for the Russell 2000 (RUT) small-cap index, which has fallen sharply even while the S&P 500 (purple line) is pretty much flat. Some economists say small-caps can sometimes be a leading indicator, either positive or negative. Data source: FTSE Russell, S&P Dow Jones Indices. Chart source: The thinkorswim® platform from TD Ameritrade. For illustrative purposes only. Past performance does not guarantee future results.\n\n**Talking Techs** : Though the psychological 2800 level marks a near-term support/resistance level for the S&P 500 (SPX), according to analysts, a plunge below that might potentially open up the way toward another test of the 200-day moving average. That number now stands near 2755, and the SPX pushed above the 200-day last month for the first time since last year\'s holiday-season sell-off. The 2750 level might have broader significance. Looking back over the last year, it arguably forms kind of a pivot point, with the SPX spending about half its time above that level and half below. The index keeps being drawn toward it like a moth to a flame, whether from above or below. Another thing technical traders sometimes keep an eye on is stochastics, and the SPX\'s fast stochastic has fallen over the last week from levels that traditionally signal "overbought" into a more normal range. It\'s been in the "overbought" range most of this year.\n\n**RUT Rout** : Small-caps took by far the biggest losses in last Friday\'s sell-off, with the small-cap Russell 2000 (RUT) falling more than 3%. The RUT took a beating in part because it\'s exposed than the S&P 500 (SPX) to the banking sector, with banks making up about one-quarter of the index. The entire Financial sector has been under pressure lately from dovish Fed policy and worries about economic slowing in the U.S. and around the world. In addition, the RUT\'s having its worst monthly under-performance vs. the SPX since 2002, Bloomberg noted. While the SPX is about flat over the last month, the RUT is down nearly 6%. For anyone who believes the old market adage about small stocks sometimes being a leading indicator for the overall market, that number probably doesn\'t look too promising. However, it\'s always a good idea to take the old adages in stride. Remember what they say about economists predicting 10 of the last seven recessions.\n\n**Seeking Guidance** : The last "earnings recession," meaning two quarters in a row or more of falling year-over-year earnings, occurred back in 2015-2016 and marked a shaky time for markets around the world. With many analysts expecting year-over-year earnings to fall 2% or more in Q1, worries about an earnings recession are starting to creep in again. However, some recent estimates for Q1 earnings results have been rising a little from their lows, and many analysts don\'t expect earnings losses in Q2 and beyond. This is an evolving situation and we won\'t really know anything until we go through earnings and see the actual numbers. Arguably the key thing to watch once Q1 earnings season starts is forward guidance from the major S&P 500 companies, which likely could give a lot more insight into how Q2 and the rest of the year might be shaping up. Some sort of resolution to the China tariff situation might help give companies more clarity, and U.S. and China negotiators are meeting this week.\n\n_Image Sourced From Google_\n\nAlthough **Alphabet Inc** (NASDAQ:GOOGL) is considering new privacy tools that could restrict cookie-tracking in Chrome, this is unlikely to be as stringent as **Apple Inc.**  (NASDAQ:AAPL)\'s Intelligent Tracking Prevention (ITP) in Safari, according to KeyBanc Capital Markets.\n\nThat news, however, could create pressure on **Criteo SA \'s **(NASDAQ:CRTO) stock until there\'s more clarity on Google\'s plans.\n\n### The Analyst\n\nKeyBanc\'s Andy Hargreaves on Tuesday downgraded Criteo to Sector Weight.\n\nSunTrust also downgraded the stock to Hold.\n\n### The Thesis\n\nWith a market share of 65 percent, Chrome is the world\'s leading browser. The privacy tools being considered by Google could restrict third-party tracking, causing "massive disruption" to Criteo as well as the digital ad industry, Hargreaves said in a note.\n\nAlthough Safari has ITP in place, the impact of Google adopting such tools will be far more disruptive. While Chrome is the world\'s leading browser, Google\'s AdX is the world\'s largest programmatic exchange, Hargreaves said. He added that if Chrome prevents cross-site tracking cookies, Criteo\'s retargeting platform will be completely disrupted.\n\nGiven the magnitude of the impact, Google may focus on enhancing personal privacy while retaining Chrome\'s tracking features. The analyst wrote, however, that the possibility of Google putting an end to tracking features in Chrome could be an overhang on Criteo shares for several quarters.\n\n### Price Action\n\nCriteo\'s stock dropped 14 percent Tuesday morning to $18.90 per share.\n\n_Related Links:_\n\n_Avaya Soars Amid Report Of A Possible Leveraged Buyout_\n\n_How Google \'s Stadia Video Game Streamer Will Be \'Highly Disruptive\'_\n\n**Apple Inc.** (NASDAQ:AAPL) announced Monday it will launch its own branded credit card called Apple Card and this should be viewed as a positive for **Green Dot Corporation** (NYSE:GDOT), according to Guggenheim.\n\n### The Analyst\n\nGuggenheim Partners\' Jeff Cantwell maintains a Buy rating on Green Dot with an unchanged $87 price target.\n\n### The Thesis\n\nGreen Dot is a provider of custom banking solutions and will likely play a big role in Apple\'s rewards system for its new credit card, Cantwell said in a research report. Specifically, Apple will offer a cashback reward program of 3 percent for purchases in the Apple ecosystem, 2 percent for transactions on Apple Pay and 1 percent for purchases made with the physical card. These rewards consumers accumulate will be stored in an Apple account powered by Green Dot.\n\nGreen Dot will see revenue from float income on rewards balances held by consumers in their account and interchange income on rewards balances as they\'re spent by consumers, the analyst wrote.\n\nBottom line, Apple should see "solid demand" for its new credit card that will offer attractive terms that\'s "smartly tied" into the Apple ecosystem. As such, Green Dot investors could see "significant" long-term benefits.\n\n### Goldman CEO: New Experience\n\nApple Card will be launched with its financial partner **Goldman Sachs Group Inc** (NYSE:GS). In a letter to employees, Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon said the new credit card will completely change the "credit card experience" by introducing a new and transparent card that is "on the side of the customer," according to CNBC.\n\n"This partnership is a major step in the growth of our consumer franchise, furthering our vision to create the leading digital consumer platform," Solomon was quoted by CNBC as saying in the letter.\n\n### Price Action\n\nShares of Green Dot were trading 2.6 lower at $59.44 Tuesday morning.\n\n_Related Links:_\n\n_Barclays Initiates Coverage Of Payments Sector, Names PayPal As Top Pick_\n\n_BTIG Raises Apple\'s Price Target, But Stock Could Be \'Ripe\' For Near-Term Sell-Off_\n\nPhoto courtesy of Apple.\n\n  * Oppenheimer raised the price target for **Goldman Sachs Group Inc** (NYSE:GS) from $302 to $312.

 'U.S. International Trade Commission members said in a Tuesday ruling that **Apple Inc.** (NASDAQ:AAPL) did not violate a patent controlled by **Qualcomm, Inc.** (NASDAQ:QCOM).\n\n### What Happened\n\nQualcomm argued in a case brought forward to the ITC in 2017 that Apple violated its patents related to techniques to extending battery life on its phones and handling data efficiently, The Wall Street Journal reported.\n\nThe court\'s ruling in Apple\'s favor is notable, as it overrules a prior ruling in September that said Apple violated a Qualcomm patent.\n\nIn a separate ruling Tuesday, an ITC judge said in initial comments that an import ban of certain iPhone devices made in China will be recommended, according to WSJ. The decision is not final and the initial comments will be discussed by a six-member ITC panel that has one open slot.\n\n### Why It\'s Important\n\nThe long-lasting legal feud between the two companies culminated in a decision which may sound "most concerning" to investors but in reality is mostly "noise," Loup Ventures\' Gene Munster told Bloomberg TV.\n\n"We are going to see some varying degrees of announcements both for Qualcomm and for Apple, but that doesn\'t change the trajectory of where the relationship between Apple and Qualcomm is going," the tech venture capitalist said. "And that relationship is moving in a direction where they will eventually be separate." \n\nWhat\'s Next\n\nTuesday\'s decision also marks an "irritation" for Apple, but the iPhone maker could take it as an opportunity to accelerate its move to become independent of Qualcomm, Munster said. \n\nApple shares were trading 1.53-percent higher at $189.64 at the time of publication Wednesday, while Qualcomm shares were down 1.74 percent at $56.99. \n\n_Related Links:_\n\n_Sell-Side Stays On Sidelines With Qualcomm, Awaits Resolution Of Licensing Disputes_\n\n_Kerrisdale: Qualcomm Ruling Could Cut\'Stock Price In Half\'_\n\n_Photo courtesy of Qualcomm.  _\n\nShares of **Trade Desk Inc** (NASDAQ:TTD) have nosedived 12 percent since Friday morning amid investor concern over **Alphabet Inc**(NASDAQ:GOOGL) (NASDAQ:GOOG) possibly considering restrictions on third-party ad targeting on Chrome.\n\nThe investor reaction appears overblown given the company\'s solid fundamentals, according to Oppenheimer.\n\n### The Analyst\n\nOppenheimer\'s Brian Schwartz maintained an Outperform rating on Trade Desk with an unchanged $210 price target.\n\n### The Thesis\n\nAdweek reported Friday that Google was considering restrictions on cookie tracking in Chrome, similar to what **Apple Inc.** (NASDAQ:AAPL) has done for its Safari browser, Schwartz said in a Wednesday note.\n\nThe pressure on Trade Desk\'s stock appears excessive, and higher estimates will lend upside to its share price, the analyst said. \n\nTrade Desk\'s Safari desktop revenue continued to grow when Apple enacted similar restrictions in the past, Schwartz said. Moreover, the company\'s key growth drivers -- ConnectedTV, mobile and China -- are strengthening and do not use browser cookies, he said. \n\nTrade Desk\'s fundamentals are solid and it is executing wel, the analyst said, adding that its business momentum continued to be strong in the first quarter. \n\n### Price Action\n\nShares of Trade Desk plummeted from above $200 to close trading at $186.94 Tuesday. The stock was down 0.37 percent at $186.24 at the time of publication Wednesday. \n\n_Related Links:_\n\n_Oppenheimer: Trade Desk Positioned For 30% Revenue, EBITDA, FCF Growth_\n\n_Oppenheimer Raises Trade Desk Price Target On Stronger Business Trends_\n\nThe interest rate shuffle might continue today, with U.S. stocks apparently taking their cue from what\'s going on in the Treasury market. A negative tone prevailed early as yields sank again.\n\nA few weeks ago, stocks and Treasuries were both marching upward in sync, which is a bit unusual. Now, things have reverted to a more typical scenario, with the two diverging. Early Wednesday, as Treasuries rose and yields fell back below 2.4% on the 10-year note, U.S. indices ticked lower amid more concern that the rate decline might indicate rough waters ahead for the economy.\n\nSome of the renewed focus on yields, when you get right down to it, might reflect the lack of other things to talk about this week. While there is some data out there, the earnings calendar is very light and the China tariff situation seems to have taken a back seat for now. As for Brexit, it\'s looking so confusing right now that the market might not know what to make of it, so it\'s not acting as a catalyst. The employment report next week followed by Financial sector earnings could be the market needs to get back to focusing more on fundamental discussions.\n\n### An Eye on Earnings\n\nSpeaking of earnings, there\'s a smattering of them Wednesday. Homebuilder **Lennar Corporation  **(NYSE:LEN) missed third-party consensus on both earnings per share and revenue as it looked like some of the soft housing numbers we\'ve seen lately might have come home to roost. However, the company offered a ray of hope in noting that mortgage rates have fallen and home prices have moderated, both of which could help the new home market to "correct itself."\n\nMeanwhile, **KB Home** (NYSE:KBH) reported better-than-expected earnings after the close Tuesday, and its shares were up in pre-market trading. On the negative side, the homebuilder did say it saw fewer home sales in the quarter--with lower prices--and its revenue was down 7%, short of third-party estimates.\n\nMore earnings are on tap after the close, highlighted by **Lululemon Athletica Inc  **(NASDAQ:LULU). Shares of LULU are outpacing the S&P 500 (SPX) so far this year, and the company raised guidance a couple of months ago.\n\nEarnings estimates for Q1 continue to look pretty soft. As of Monday, research firm CFRA predicts S&P 500 Q1 earnings will fall 2.3% year-over-year, with seven out of 11 sectors in the red. This would be the first year-over-year earnings decline since the 2015-16 "earnings recession" when earnings fell year-over-year four quarters in a row \n\nOn the data side, the only major number coming out today is the weekly U.S. crude stockpiles report. Last week saw a much bigger than expected draw of nearly 10 million barrels, and supplies are below the five-year average. U.S. crude prices hovered just under $60 a barrel early Wednesday, near four-month highs. Another big crude draw might indicate continued strength in the economy, though keep in mind that we\'re heading into what\'s seasonally a strong time for crude demand.\n\nU.S. markets have been on a bit of a roller coaster over the last week amid all the rate worries, but remain solidly higher for the year as we near the end of Q1. At the end of trading Tuesday, the SPX was up 12.4% year-to-date, and the Nasdaq (COMP) was doing even better with nearly 16% gains. The small-cap Russell 2000 (RUT), which has been lagging the SPX lately, out-performed it Tuesday with 1% gains.\n\n### Recovery Tuesday\n\nTuesday\'s rally looked broad and pretty convincing, with all S&P 500 sectors finishing in the green. Even Financials, which had struggled the last week amid worries about falling rates and what they might say about the economy, joined in the cheer. Financials--which seemed to take their cue from the stabilizing rates--were among the best performers of the day, rising more than 1%. Another star was Energy, also up more than 1% as crude oil prices jumped back to $60 a barrel amid expectations for falling U.S. inventories.\n\nWhile cyclical sectors like Info Tech, Materials, and Industrials were also on the day\'s leaderboard, the so-called "defensive" sectors like Utilities and Health Care also registered solid days, with Health Care getting a lift from strength in the biotech sector. Biotech had slumped over the last month following a hot start to 2019, and is typically a sector that does well when investors feel optimistic about the economy.\n\nThe strength on the defensive side of the field also could be seen in the Treasury market, where 10-year yields stayed near recent low levels just above 2.4%, down from around 2.7% at the start of the year and 3.2% at the end of last summer. The Fed\'s meeting last week with no more rate hikes apparently in the works for 2019 continues to pull the market in two directions. On the one hand, companies and the economy in general don\'t appear to face the threat of higher rates, but on the other, the Fed\'s dovish stance raises concerns about the health of U.S. and world economies. The 10-year fell below 2.4% early Wednesday and is now back below where it was at the start of last year.\n\n### Data Don\'t Send Positive Signal\n\nMore data poured in Tuesday, and it generally didn\'t look too promising. February housing starts and building permits fell short of Wall Street analysts\' estimates, with housing starts sliding nearly 9% from a month earlier and single-family starts looking particularly weak. The housing market has generally been soft, but there are some hopes among economists that recent cheaper mortgage rates might give the sector a kick start. Home builder stocks traded mostly lower Tuesday on the fresh data, which didn\'t offer much evidence of improvement.\n\nThe other data Tuesday was March consumer confidence, and it also came up shy of estimates and below the February number. Consumer confidence has now declined in five of the last six months, Briefing.com noted. However, there are plenty of signs of consumer health, too. \n\nIt\'s possible the weak data might have played a role in the market\'s stepping back from sharp early gains Tuesday. Another factor could have been **Apple Inc  **(NASDAQ:AAPL) shares reversing from green to red after Bloomberg reported that a U.S. trade judge ruled against AAPL and for **Qualcomm, Inc.  **(NASDAQ:QCOM) in a patent case. The judge recommended that some imported AAPL iPhones should be blocked from the U.S. as a result. AAPL got an apparent lift early Wednesday when the U.S. International Trade Commission ruled against an import ban, media outlets reported.\n\n### VIX Settling Back Down\n\nVolatility, which came roaring back last Friday, has spent the last two days retreating. By the end of the day Tuesday, the VIX was back below 15 after a jump to above 17 last week. While VIX seems to be hibernating a little for now, the quick rise on Friday could indicate a bit of jumpiness in the market. That means the turbulence may not be over yet, and could resurface if, for instance, some unexpected news comes in. Remember, U.S. and Chinese negotiators were meeting this week on trade, so it might be prudent to keep an ear open for any headlines or tweets that might come out of that.\n\nAlso, it might be worth considering that Friday is the last trading day of the quarter. Sometimes the quarter\'s end is marked by some "window dressing" as fund managers shift positions before sending out quarterly statements. Investors might want to consider taking extra care in any moves they make this week because sometimes volume can pick up at times like these.\n\n**UP FOR AIR** : After a sharp descent since mid-month, Financials (candlestick) finally had an up day Tuesday. That might have had something to with stabilizing 10-year Treasury yields (purple line), though they remain down significantly over the last few weeks. Data Source: S&P Dow Jones Indices, Cboe.  Chart source: The thinkorswim® platform from TD Ameritrade. For illustrative purposes only. Past performance does not guarantee future results.\n\n**GDP To Pay a Call** : Thursday morning brings the government\'s second estimate of Q4 gross domestic product, and analyst estimates going into the data are for a slight downward course. The Briefing.com consensus stands at 2.5%, down a tick from 2.6% last time out. Beyond the headline number, investors might want to also focus on the updated government estimate for consumer spending during Q4, which last came in at a 2.8% rise. That was down from well above 3% the previous two quarters, but still relatively strong in a category closely watched for signs of consumer health. The real question might be what personal spending (and GDP) ended up being in Q1, which closes out at the end of this week. We won\'t find out until late last month, but the Atlanta Fed\'s GDPNow indicator for Q1 rose to 1.3% on Tuesday, up from the previous 1.2%. The 1.3% is roughly in line with many economists\' estimates, and would be the lowest quarterly GDP growth since 2015.\n\n**Minding All the Gaps** : Lost in the shuffle this week amid all the focus on inversion in the Treasury complex is that the gaps between a number of key Treasury yields have been stable or actually getting wider. While the three-month Treasury yield continued to hold about a four-basis point premium to the 10-year yield Tuesday, the spread between the two-year and 10-year yields widened to 15 basis points, up from single digits at its low. In addition, the spread between 10-year and 30-year yields has been pretty stable recently and is wider than it was at the start of the month. Some analysts who look back at the historic data say the three-month to 10-year inversion, at least in the past, hasn\'t signaled imminent pain for the stock market, though you never can bet on history repeating. A more dramatic inversion in some of the longer-term yields might be more substantive, but at this point that hasn\'t come too close to happening. \n\n**A Little M &A With Those Fries?:** In M&A news, **McDonald \'s Corporation **(NYSE:MCD) turned away momentarily from its focus on food to announce a planned $300 million purchase of Dynamic Yield Ltd., a digital start-up company that MCD says can help it improve its drive-through technology. This purchase could be seen as a sign of the times, because it reinforces the importance of technology across all aspects of the economy. Also on the M&A front this week, Uber Technologies announced it will acquire Middle East rival Careem Networks for $3.1 billion. Uber plans to have its IPO next month.\n\nThat\'s two interesting M&A announcements this week alone, but M&A activity got off to a relatively slow start this year, according to Axios. Through roughly the first two months of 2019, M&A was well below the same pace a year ago despite a couple of major deals including **Bristol-Myers Squibb \'s** (NYSE:BMY) acquisition of **Celgene Corporation  **(NASDAQ:CELG), a $74 billion deal. This year has a lot to live up to if it\'s going to keep pace with last year\'s historically strong M&A levels.\n\n_Information from TDA is not intended to be investment advice or construed as a recommendation or endorsement of any particular investment or investment strategy, and is for illustrative purposes only.
