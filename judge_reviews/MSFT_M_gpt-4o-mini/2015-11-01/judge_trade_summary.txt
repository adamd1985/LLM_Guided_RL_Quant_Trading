News Factors Considered:
['On CNBC\'s Fast Money Halftime Report, Pete Najarian spoke about unusually high bullish options activity in **Microsoft Corporation** (NASDAQ: MSFT) ahead of the earnings results, which are scheduled for Thursday. He noticed that there was a lot of activity in the October 30, 49 strike calls and the October 30, 50 strike calls on Monday and he decided to follow the trade. Najarian explained that Microsoft Corporation is one of the names he loves and he wanted an excuse to get back in. Besides the options activity, he also likes the fundamentals of the name and he has a lot of faith in Microsoft Corporation\'s CEO. Najarian thinks that the company still has growth and he explained that it will take some time before the cloud segment of its business gets as big as investors want. He believes that the stock is going to reach $50. Microsoft Corp. on Monday announced two nominations to its board of directors, Sandra Peterson, group worldwide chairman, Johnson & Johnson, and member of the executive committee, and Padmasree Warrior, former chief strategy officer and chief technology officer at Cisco. Both are accomplished business leaders with significant experience directly relevant to Microsoft\'s strategic vision and business strategies. They will be presented for election at the company\'s annual shareholders meeting on Dec. 2, 2015. Microsoft also announced that Dr. Maria Klawe, president, Harvey Mudd College, has decided not to seek re-election and will leave the board of directors at the expiration of her current term, following the annual shareholders meeting in December. "We thank Dr. Klawe for her many contributions to the board and her leadership on STEM initiatives over these past six years," said John Thompson, independent board chairman. "In my six years serving on Microsoft\'s board, I am proud of the role I\'ve played to help shape Microsoft\'s business, its leadership and impactful programs," Klawe said. "Now is the right time for me to take a step back from my responsibilities on the board, so that I can take on a larger role in helping to ensure the future of the Claremont University Consortium endowment." "Sandra and Padmasree both offer strong technology expertise and business experience that will serve as valuable additions to the board," Thompson said. Peterson, 56, has served as the group worldwide chairman and member of the executive committee of Johnson & Johnson since December 2012. With more than 265 operating companies in more than 60 countries, Johnson & Johnson is the largest and most diversified health care company in the world, with leading consumer health, pharmaceutical and medical device businesses. Peterson previously served as chairman of the board of management of Bayer CropScience AG (a subsidiary of Bayer AG) from 2010 to 2012 and, before that, as a member of Bayer CropScience AG\'s board of management from July 2010 through September 2010. Before that, Peterson served as executive vice president and president, Medical Care, Bayer HealthCare LLC, from 2005 to 2010, group president of government for Medco Health Solutions Inc. (formerly Merck-Medco) from 2003 to 2004, senior vice president of Medco\'s health businesses from 2001 through 2003, and senior vice president of marketing for Merck-Medco Managed Care LLC from 1999 to 2001. She serves on the board of Dun & Bradstreet Corp. Warrior, 54, served as strategic Advisor to Cisco Systems Inc., a leading global networking equipment provider, from June to September 2015. Before that, she was chief technology and strategy officer from July 2012 to June 2015 and served as chief technology officer, senior vice president engineering and general manager global enterprise segment from 2010 to 2012. She joined Cisco in 2008 as the chief technology officer. Before joining Cisco, Warrior served in various executive roles at Motorola Inc., a mobile device and telecommunications company, from 1999 to 2007, most recently as executive vice president and chief technology officer from 2003 to 2007. Warrior currently serves on the board of directors of The Gap Inc., a retail apparel company, and Box Inc., a cloud-based, mobile-optimized enterprise content collaboration platform. If elected, Microsoft\'s board of directors will consist of 11 members including the additions of Peterson and Warrior; John W. Thompson, Microsoft independent chairman and chief executive officer of Virtual Instruments; William H. Gates, Microsoft founder and technology advisor; Teri List-Stoll, executive vice president and chief financial officer of DICK\'S Sporting Goods Inc.; G. Mason Morfit, president, ValueAct Capital; Satya Nadella, chief executive officer, Microsoft; Charles H. Noski, former vice chairman of Bank of America Corp.; Dr. Helmut Panke, former chairman of the board of management at BMW AG; Charles W. Scharf, chief executive officer of Visa Inc.; and John W. Stanton, chairman, Trilogy Equity Partners and Trilogy International Partners. On CNBC\'s Options Action, Carter Worth analyzed **Microsoft Corporation** (NASDAQ: MSFT) from a technical standpoint. Worth said that the technology stocks performed significantly better than the S&P; 500 after the August low. The biggest outperformer was **Intel Corporation** (NASDAQ: INTC), which gained around 30 percent. Microsoft Corporation gained around 20 percent from its August lows, but according to Worth\'s analysis, historically it has been very correlated to Intel Corporation. Worth identified a pattern on Microsoft Corporation\'s chart which suggests to him that the stock is going to break out on the upside. The stock has been trading in a range in 2015 after a strong uptrend and Worth believes that it is ready now to catch up with Intel Corporation. It is also interesting that Microsoft Corporation\'s is going to report earnings on Thursday. The stock currently has a 3.1 percent dividend yield. Mike Khouw doesn\'t expect a huge break out above $50 in Microsoft Corporation\'s and he suggested a calendar call spread to exploit a small move higher. He wants to sell the October 48 call and buy the October 48 call for $1.50. The break even for this trade is at $48.90 or approximately 3 percent higher from the stock\'s current price.'
 'On CNBC\'s Options Action, Mike Khouw analyzed a bullish options trade in **Microsoft Corporation** (NASDAQ: MSFT). He said that the call options trading volume was 2.5 times higher than the average daily call volume and the most of the action happened in the October 30 calls. A trader bought 19,000 contracts of the October 30, 49 strike calls and 19,000 contracts of the October 30, 50 strike calls. This type of structure is known as "call stupid" and the trader paid $0.50 for it. Khouw explained that "call stupid" offers lower break even with the 49 strike call, while the 50 strike call offers more leverage. He believes that this is a smart way to make a bullish bet on Microsoft Corporation.'
 'Shares of **Microsoft Corporation** (NASDAQ: MSFT) jumped over 6 percent in after-hours trading after the company reported stronger-than-expected earnings for its fiscal first quarter. The Redmond, Washington-based company reported a quarterly profit of $4.62 billion, or $0.57 per share, versus a year-ago profit of $4.54 billion, or $0.54 per share. On an adjusted basis, the company\'s earnings rose to $0.67 per share from $0.65 per share. Its revenue slipped 12 percent to $20.38 billion in the latest quarter, while revenue on an adjusted basis declined to $21.7 billion. Analysts were estimating earnings of $0.59 per share on revenue of $21.03 billion. The average estimate among 244 Estimize users was for earnings of $0.59 per share and revenue of $21.44 billion. Its gross margin expanded to 64.6 percent from 64.3 percent. The company\'s revenue in "More Personal Computing" segment declined 17 percent to $9.38 billion, while revenue in the "Intelligent Cloud" segment gained 7.6 percent to $5.89 billion. Its revenue in the "Productivity and Business Processes" segment declined 2.8 percent to $6.31 billion. "We are making strong progress across each of our three ambitions by delivering innovation people love," said Satya Nadella, chief executive officer at Microsoft. "Customer excitement for new devices, Windows 10, Office 365 and Azure is increasing as we bring together the best Microsoft experiences to empower people to achieve more." Microsoft shares gained 6.70 percent to $51.25 in the after-hours trading session. \n\nShares **Amazon.com, Inc.**(NASDAQ: AMZN) rose more than 10 percent on Thursday\'s after-hours trading session, following the announcement of the company\'s third quarter financial results. The online retailer rose on an earnings beat and strong guidance.\n\nThird quarter earnings came in at $0.17 per share on revenue of $25.358, well above the Street\'s expectations. In fact, experts were modeling a consensus net loss of ($0.10) per share on sales of $24.851 billion.\n\nShares of **Alphabet Inc**(NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG), formerly Google, also rose about 10 percent since the bell rang. The tech giant reported earnings of $7.35 per share on revenue of $15.109 billion, beating the Steet\'s consensus estimate of $7.25 per share and $15.087 billion.\n\nAlso moving on its earnings report was **Microsoft Corporation**(NASDAQ: MSFT), up roughly 5 percent since the market closed. The maker of Windows OS delivered earnings of $0.67 per share on revenue of $21.66 billion, beating experts\' forecasts, which called for earnings of $0.57 per share on sales of $21.23 billion.\n\nOn the other hand, **Pandora Media Inc**(NYSE: P) fell more than 15 percent since the bell rang - on a poor earnings report. The Internet radio company retrieved a net loss ($0.40) per share on revenue of $311.6 million, below the Street\'s expectations for earnings of $0.10 per share and revenue of $312.39 billion.\n\nFinally, there\'s **Skechers USA Inc**(NYSE: SKX), which fell approximately 25 percent on its financial results. The Street was projecting consensus earnings of $0.54 per share on revenue of $868.4 million. However, EPS came in at $0.43, and revenue, at $856.2 million.\n\n \n\n_Disclosure: Javier Hasse holds no positions in any of the securities mentioned above._\n\nE-commerce and cloud giant--and now, original programming creator--**Amazon.com, Inc.**(NASDAQ: AMZN) turns in its Q3 results after the market\'s close today. Results are expected to be colored by Amazon\'s diversification initiatives, as it continues to challenge traditional retailer models. With Amazon\'s expenses, however, comes the expectation for another loss.\n\nThomson Reuters\' surveyed analysts, on average, expect AMZN Q3 revenue up 21% to $24.9 billion compared to a year earlier. They expect a loss-per-share of $0.12. That\'s typical for AMZN, which has heavily reinvested in the firm. In fact, in the past 14 quarters, only eight have been in the black. And yet AMZN has met or outpaced Wall Street expectations in three of the last four quarters. That includes surprise Q2 profit of $92 million on sales of $23.18 billion. The Street may be more interested in comparing this Q3 to Q2\'s surprise rather than the typical year-over-year match up.\n\nAs for the big picture, industry analysts remind us that AMZN\'s business model is not just that of an online retailer mimicking traditional bricks-and-mortar stores. Its members-with-benefits program Amazon Prime and its cloud-computing Amazon Web Services are far from any gear you\'d see at the corner department store. They\'re just two examples of the enterprises that AMZN is using, it says, to further engage customers and differentiate from retailers that include the online divisions of Wal-Mart (WMT), Target (TGT), Overstock.com (OSTK), and others. The firm that some observers call an e-commerce-turned-everything provider is clearly taking on the tech giants in the fight for cloud positioning, too. In fact, some tech is trying to catch up to Amazon; one of which, Microsoft (MSFT), also reports after the close (more on it below).\n\nBank of America Merrill Lynch estimates that Amazon\'s cloud-based web services division could swell by 78% year over year and generate some $2.08 billion in sales. Web services is likely to be marginal in the company\'s current revenue, so the most useful information may come with any forward-looking company commentary on what it thinks could be a potentially high-margin division.\n\nAMZN joins other online commerce firms issuing quarterly results this week. **eBay** (NASDAQ: EBAY) in its Wednesday release--the first after a split from PayPal (PYPL)--reported a drop in profit that was less than Wall Street expected. The auction site lifted its forecast. It now expects profit at between $1.58 and $1.60 per share for all of 2015 compared with a forecast just three months ago in a range of $1.40 to $1.45.\n\nA look at the limited options volume around this stock reveals that AMZN\'s implied volatility is at an elevated 84th percentile. The short-term options market is pricing in a potential 8.5% move in either direction for the stock around its earnings release, according to the Market Maker Move indicator on TD Ameritrade\'s thinkorswimÂ® platform.\n\nAMZN\'s stock has been moving in the upper end of a 52-week range spanning roughly $284-$580 (figure 1).\n\nCloud in Focus for Microsoft, Too\n\n**Microsoft Corporation**(NASDAQ: MSFT) cloud business also will be top of mind for analysts when the technology giant reports fiscal Q1 results after the close.\n\nLike other legacy tech companies, MSFT is transitioning from a PC-based business to a commercial cloud-based enterprise with products including its Azure and Office 365. Analysts reporting to Thomson Reuters are projecting declining revenue and earnings for the quarter. On the top line, the average forecast is for a 10% year-over-year pullback on revenues to $20.96 billion. The bottom line is anticipated to shrink by 13% to $0.59 per share.\n\nLike most multinationals, MSFT is expected to feel the brunt of the stronger dollar\'s pinch on its overseas performance. In last quarter\'s report, the company said its revenue tumbled 5% but the decline was only 2% on a constant-currency basis that eliminates foreign exchange fluctuations.\n\nThe short-term options market is pricing in the chance of a 5% move in either direction for this stock around its earnings release, according to the Market Maker Move indicator on TD Ameritrade\'s thinkorswimÂ® platform. The weekly 50 calls are active, while the Oct 43 puts that expire on Friday are seeing three times the normal amount of interest. Note: Call options represent the right, but not the obligation, to buy the underlying security at a predetermined price and over a set period of time; the same applies to put options, which represent the right, but not the obligation, to sell the underlying security at a predetermined price over a set period of time.\n\nAT&T: What\'s Next for DirecTV?\n\nTelecom **AT &T Inc.** (NYSE: T) joins the Q3 earnings parade after the closing bell. Industry analyst are looking for a 23% jump in revenues compared to a year earlier, thanks in part to T\'s acquisition of DirecTV in July. The buy positioned T as the largest pay-television company in the U.S.\n\nAnalysts reporting to Thomson Reuters expect top line sales to jump to $40.6 billion from $33 billion reported in the year-ago period. On a per-share basis, analysts are looking for $0.69 compared with the $0.63 AT&T made last year.\n\nAn AT&T spokesman on Wednesday issued a statement that said Wall Street\'s earnings prognosticators are miscalculating revenue around the accounting for the DirecTV deal. The spokesman said Q3 revenue will likely miss Wall Street\'s general consensus as a result.\n\nThe telecom industry has been in a dog-eat-dog battle for customers this year and industry analysts admit they are hungry for any insight T offers on its metrics compared with its biggest rival Verizon (VZ), as well as smaller players **Sprint Corp** (NYSE: S) and **T-Mobile US** (NYSE: TMUS). For instance, analysts are interested in T\'s outlook for DirecTV and plans for its wireless business.\n\nIndustry analysts are also anxious for updates on how things are going in Mexico, where T shelled out more than $4 billion for two carriers earlier this year and said it\'s launching a $3 billion overhaul of its network.\n\nThe short-term options market is pricing in the chance of a 3% move in either direction for this stock around its earnings release, according to the thinkorswimÂ® platform\'s Market Maker Move indicator. Options trading volume early on Thursday was almost three times the norm. The call and put activity is about evenly split, with weekly 33 puts and weekly 34 calls both drawing interest.

While blending corporate cultures and moving forward as a single entity is often trying for two companies that recently joined forces, some would argue that just setting the deal up is the most difficult step. Many of Wall Street\'s biggest potential deals have fallen through for a host of reasons including regulatory issues, shareholder pushback and bidding wars. Over the past 20 years, markets have watched some of the biggest potential partnerships nearly come to fruition, only to fall through at the last second. Here\'s a look at some of the biggest M&A; deals that never actually happened. **1\\. US Treasury Crushes AbbVie\'s Plans To Purchase Shire** More often than not, regulators get in the way of deals that might otherwise be profitable. For **AbbVie Inc** (NASDAQ: ABBV)) inversion laws were to blame for ruining the pharmaceutical firm\'s plans to acquire **Shire PLC**(NASDAQ: SHPG). The two had agreed to a $54 billion deal that would have seen AbbVie move its headquarters overseas to Europe. In doing so, AbbVie would have saved on corporate taxes, but the US Treasury passed new inversion laws just before the deal was completed, making the agreement much less profitable for AbbVie. In the end, AbbVie opted to pay a $1.635 billion break-up fee rather than go through with the deal sans tax breaks, and a debate about the new laws ensued. Since that time, the Treasury\'s new rules have prevented a number of firms from dodging taxes through overseas acquisitions. **2\\. AstraZeneca Narrowly Avoids Takeover** In 2014, US pharmaceutical giant **Pfizer** (NYSE: PFE) was on the hunt for yet another acquisition, this time targeting British rival **AstraZeneca plc** (NYSE: AZN). The two went through a month of hostile negotiations that ended with Pfizer making a $118 billion offer to AstraZeneca\'s board. The UK-based drugmaker rejected the offer, saying that it undervalued the firm leaving Pfizer to decide whether or not to put the offer to AstraZeneca shareholders. In the end, Pfizer opted to leave the decision up to the board and walked away from the deal. At the time, many expected that Pfizer would revisit its acquisition plans later, but new inversion rules that take away from the tax benefits of international mergers have made that situation an unlikely one. **3\\. Omnicom And Publicis Groupe Just Couldn\'t Get Along** One of the biggest reasons that mergers fail is the inability of two separate entities to effectively combine. Differing opinions regarding how the new firm should be run, what the corporate culture will be like and how leadership will change have been the backbone some disastrous unions in the past. That\'s what may have happened to ad firms **Omnicom Group Inc.** (NYSE: OMC) and**Publicis Groupe** (OTC: PUBGY) had they not realized their differences before their merger was complete. In the spring of 2014, a partnership between France\'s Publicis Groupe and US-based Omnicom fell apart at the seams when leaders of the two firms were unable to resolve a power struggle over how the new entity would be managed. Everything from how positions should be filled to the way the firm\'s management would spit became a competition, and both companies worried that they were losing their "equal partner" status. Many thought the deal would create a new advertising superpower to move forward into the tech age, but too many disparities led both firms to throw in the towel before the agreement was finalized. **4\\. Sysco Shies Away From US Foods** Often, Wall Street heavyweights look to the old adage, "If you can\'t beat them, join them" when it comes to M&A.; That was the case for **Sysco Corp** (NYSE: SYY) in 2013 when the firm proposed an acquisition deal worth around $8.2 billion of rival US Foods. Together, the two would have made up around 75 percent of the food distribution market in the US, creating a powerful industry leader. However, after years of negotiations, the deal was quashed by a ruling from the Federal Trade Commission which said such a partnership would have a negative impact on competition. Though Sysco could have challenged the ruling, CEO Bill DeLaney announced in 2015 that the firm would instead pay a $300 million termination fee to US foods and walk away from the deal. **5\\. American Home Products Is Outbid For Warner-Lambert** Sometimes, M&A; deals are further complicated by heated bidding wars. In November 1999, that was the situation for Warner-Lambert, a pharmaceutical company being courted by American Home Products. Both firms\' boards had approved a $53.8 billion merger deal and were set to complete in the second quarter of 2000. However, before the deal was final, **Pfizer** (NYSE: PFE) submitted its own $84.2 billion bid for Warner-Lambert. The ordeal threatened to spark a bidding war for Warner-Lambert, with **Procter & Gamble** (NYSE: PG) even considering entering the ring. However, in the end Pfizer went on to acquire Warner-Lambert, albeit with some resentment from Warner-Lambert execs. American Home Products didn\'t go home empty handed though, Pfizer agreed to pay the firm a $1.8 billion break-up fee, the largest ever at the time. **6\\. Comcast Fails To Buy Disney** Hostile takeovers are a reality of the M&A; landscape, but corporate bullies don\'t always get their way. In 2004, media giant**Comcast Corp**(NYSE: CMCSA) made a play for **Walt Disney** (NYSE: DIS) in an effort to create one of the largest media firms in the world. Comcast proposed a deal worth $66 billion, but Disney CEO Michael Eisner quickly rejected the offer. However, in the wake of Comcast\'s proposal, Eisner was ousted from the company\'s board, leading some to speculate that the firm\'s leadership was interested in discussing a deal. In the end, Disney\'s board was opposed to the possibility of a merger and Comcast decided to abandon it\'s plans and withdrew its bid. **7\\. Regulators Block MCI WorldCom Offer To Buy Sprint** The telecom landscape could look very different today if European regulators hadn\'t stepped in to block MCI WorldCom\'s plans to acquire**Sprint Corp** (NYSE: S). In 1999, MCI outbid BellSouth with a $129 billion deal to join the two firms and create an international telecom superpower. However, the European Commission stepped in saying that the new entity would stifle competition, leaving the deal dead in the water. Things only went downhill for WorldCom after that; the firm eventually went bankrupt due to accounting fraud and was eventually snapped up by **Verizon** (NYSE: VZ). **8\\. Microsoft Deterred From Intuit Purchase** Back in 1994, **Microsoft Corporation** (NASDAQ: MSFT) was planning to execute the software industry\'s largest ever acquisition with a $1.5 billion deal to buy **Intuit Inc.** (NASDAQ: INTU). The deal would have seen Microsoft take ownership of Intuit\'s wildly popular Quicken financial software which boasted around six million users. However, as Microsoft owned the Money, the only rival product to Quicken at the time, the US Justice Department sued to block the deal. Bill Gates, Microsoft\'s then CEO, decided to abandon the acquisition rather than fight the case saying that a drawn-out court case would be detrimental to the firm\'s progress in the financial software market at a time when demand for such products was on the rise. **9\\. Dynegy Dodges Enron Bullet** In 2001, Dynegy Inc was set to carry out a $9 billion merger with Enron Corp. However, the firm pulled out at the last minute when Standard & Poor\'s cut Enron\'s debt to "junk bond" status and worries that the firm was teetering on the edge of bankruptcy began to emerge. Following the failed merger, Enron filed for bankruptcy and sued Dynegy for what it said were disingenuous negotiations. In the end, Enron unraveled in the public eye and Dynegy later acquired one of Enron\'s pipelines. **10\\. Dollar General Loses The Battle Of The Dollar Stores** At the beginning of 2015, discount chain **Family Dollar Stores, Inc.** (NYSE: FDO) found itself bogged down in a bidding war between **Dollar General** (NYSE: DG) and **Dollar Tree** (NASDAQ: DLTR). Dollar General, the leader in the dollar store space, had been working for years to acquire rival Family Dollar without success. However, when activist investor Carl Icahn bought purchased a near 10 percent stake in Family Dollar and began pushing for a merge with Dollar General, the tables began to turn. Dollar General\'s takeover efforts were complicated by a surprise bid from Dollar Tree, presenting Family Dollar shareholders with a choiceâ€” take an $8.7 billion bid from Dollar Tree to bring together the second and third largest dollar store retailers, or accept a higher $9.1 billion offer from industry leader Dollar General. Shareholders overwhelmingly supported Dollar Tree\'s bid, leaving Dollar General to compete with a new market superpower. The very public dollar store spat also raised questions about the involvement of activist investors in M&A; deals and led some firms to call for new rules limiting activist investors\' power. **Pre-open movers** US stock futures traded higher in early pre-market trade, ahead of earnings from **McDonald\'s Corporation** (NYSE: MCD), **Amazon.com, Inc.** (NASDAQ: AMZN), **Microsoft Corporation** (NASDAQ: MSFT) and **Alphabet Inc** (NASDAQ: GOOGL).

 'Heading into a trading week packed with a pivotal Federal Reserve meeting and another flutter of earnings news, major stock averages have now retraced about half of the "panic selloff" that rocked a sleepy August.\n\nThe S&P 500 (SPX), pushed above 2070 on Friday, sits above its August 25 closing low, but is still 4.6% below its May 21 record high (figure 1). The drop in SPX has paired with a 41% drop over three months for the CBOE Volatility Index (VIX), one measure of broad-market jitters (figure 2).\n\nThat fairly quick recovery may leave stock averages vulnerable to profit taking should this coming week\'s earnings fail to reach the bar set when a trio of technology heavies--**Microsoft Corporation**(NASDAQ: MSFT), Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL), and **Amazon.com, Inc.** (NASDAQ: AMZN)--largely beat Street expectations.\n\nIn fact, that threesome capped a week that featured mostly encouraging earnings news across select industrials and consumer companies. Analyst sentiment on Q3 earnings has improved thanks to a string of stronger-than-expected results from blue-chips. It appears that Wall Street analysts, and perhaps investors, are getting used to reports tinted by a global economic slowing and a strong dollar\'s dent on multinationals\' profits. Estimates and share prices may better reflect corporate reality, inviting mostly upside surprises when the numbers are off target.\n\n### Delicate Situation For The Fed\n\nCompany-focused news will share the marquee with a two-day Fed gathering that at one time was considered to be all but a lock for an interest rate hike. No so true anymore. The strong dollar, China-triggered global growth worries, and inconsistent U.S. economic indicators have potentially sidelined the central bank\'s plans to reverse recession-era interest rate levels. For now.\n\nThe Fed wraps its two-day session with a statement at 2 p.m. Eastern on Wednesday, October 28. The majority of Fed watchers expect no action from the panel then, but market-driving news could still emerge especially if the Fed lays any groundwork for its December meeting and early 2016.\n\nThe CME Group\'s FedWatch Tool, calculated based on pricing in the Fed funds futures market, shows traders are pricing in about a 7% chance the Fed moves next week to raise rates for the first time since 2006. The tool shows about a 39% shot for a rate hike in December and a 60% chance for a hike in March.\n\nThe Fed--with rhetoric that indicates it\'s poised to raise rates at the first sign the U.S. is back on track--is a rogue among its central bank brethren. Most other large-nation central banks are either cutting rates--China cut benchmark lending rates on Friday for the sixth time in roughly a year--or have shown little intention to remove ultra-loose policy anytime soon. Just last week, the European Central Bank (ECB) made it clear that extra stimulus measures are still on the table as needed. The Bank of Japan is holding its own monetary policy meeting on Oct. 30.\n\nA couple of economic indicators could be of particular importance to a convening Fed. On Tuesday, durable goods data hits. It can be a useful indicator for gauging whether improving hiring trends are producing the kind of wages that translate into big-ticket spending. The first look at Q3 gross domestic product (GDP), the broadest measure of the economy\'s health, hits the tape on Thursday (see the full economic calendar in figure 3 below).\n\n### Shiny Apple?\n\n### \n\nCome Tuesday post-close, **Apple Inc.**(NASDAQ: AAPL) is in the hot seat. Can it repeat the general upbeat tone delivered for other big-name tech this earnings round? Investor expectations could be running high for any management chatter on expected holiday sales. Investors will also be dissecting iPhone upgrade sales against the risk that a global slowdown has eaten into sales.\n\nA poll of analysts by S&P Capital IQ shows a consensus of 40 analysts looking for $1.29 per share in AAPL\'s fiscal Q4, up from $1.18 a year earlier. The survey pegs revenue at $39.4 billion, up from $37.5 billion a year earlier.\n\n### Plenty More Earnings, Too\n\nMonday\'s earnings line-up is lengthy and features a trio of pharmaceutical giants: **Bristol Myers Squibb** (NYSE: BMY),**Pfizer** (NYSE: PFE), and**Merck & Co., Inc.** (NYSE: MRK), a sector that could continue to draw interest as the political climate heats up. Tuesday also features results from **Twitter Inc** (NYSE: TWTR) as Wall Street continues to rate its leadership shuffle. Other social media earnings releases include **LinkedIn Corp** (NYSE: LNKD) on Thursday.**Facebook Inc** (NASDAQ: FB) is up with its results on November 4.\n\nThe energy sector has seemingly been off the radar for a few weeks but that could change as **Exxon Mobil Corporation** (NYSE: XOM) and **Chevron**(NYSE: CVX) release results on Friday. U.S.-traded crude fell to a three-week low, widening its discount to Europe-traded Brent. Prices recently tried but failed to test $50 a barrel again as U.S. inventories expanded for a fourth week through Oct. 16, keeping supplies more than 100 million barrels above the five-year seasonal average, according to the Energy Information Administration.\n\nInclusion of specific security names in this commentary does not constitute a recommendation from TD Ameritrade to buy, sell, or hold.

Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) shares are trading higher by $0.92 at $53.79 in Monday\'s session. It is adding to its historic rally on Friday following a better-than-expected Q1 report. After a lower open, it immediately bottomed at $52.52 and rallied well into the $53 handle, reaching $53.98 thus far. The intraday high coincides with Friday\'s high of $54.07. \n\nOn Tuesday, **Apple Inc.** (NASDAQ: AAPL), still the largest U.S. company by market capitalization, reports fiscal fourth-quarter earnings.\n\n \n\n"The iPhone and Apple Watch maker will post earnings of $1.91 per share for its fiscal fourth quarter, if Estimize\'s consensus forecast is accurate. That would be up from $1.42 per share in the year-ago period. Wall Street is looking for EPS of $1.88 for the quarter, as well as $9.13 for the full year," reports Benzinga. \n\n \n\nFew if any earnings reports are as widely anticipated and highly scrutinized as Apple\'s. Plus, the company faces heady earnings competition as rivals **Amazon.com Inc.** (NASDAQ: AMZN), **Alphabet Inc.** (NASDAQ: GOOG) and **Microsoft Corp.** (NASDAQ: MSFT) delivered boffo results last week. Not to mention, analysts and investors will be eagerly listening to what the iPhone maker has to say about December quarter iPhone sales estimates.\n\n \n\nWith all that to consider, it is arguably surprising that Apple-heavy exchange traded funds have recently been docile, at least in terms of inflows. Perhaps the best of saying that is "Inflows?" because two of the ETFs with some of the largest weights to shares of Apple have recently seen modest outflows.\n\n \n\nFor example, the **Technology Select Sector SPDR** (NYSE: XLK), the larges technology sector ETF, has lost almost $56 million in assets this month. That is a small slice of XLK\'s $12.2 billion assets under management, but it could be seen as a commentary on what investors are expecting out of Apple\'s earnings reports when considering XLK allocates almost 15.8 percent of its weight to Apple. That is about 620 basis points more than XLK\'s weight to Microsoft, the ETF\'s second-largest holding. \n\n \n\nThe **Vanguard Information Technology ETF** (NYSE: VGT), which has a 15.5 percent weight to shares of Apple, has lost $2.8 million. VGT, one of the least expensive tech ETFs with an annual expense ratio of 0.12 percent, features Apple as its largest holding to the tune of 640 basis points over Alphabet. \n\n \n\nWhile there have been modest departures this quarter from XLK and VGT, investors have added $26.5 million to the **iShares U.S. Technology ETF** (NYSE: IYW). With an Apple weight of almost 18.6 percent, the $2.68 billion IYW has more Apple exposure than any other ETF.\n\n \n\nThe one Apple that has legitimately shined in terms of fourth-quarter inflows is the **PowerShares QQQ** (NASDAQ: QQQ). QQQ, the NASDAQ-100 tracking ETF, has a 12.8 percent weight to Apple, putting the iPad maker ahead of Microsoft by 480 basis points in the ETF. Investors have added $1.17 billion in new asset to QQQ this quarter.\n\n \n\nHowever, it can be debated whether those inflows are in anticipation of Apple\'s Tuesday earnings report or in reaction to the results delivered by Alphabet, Amazon and Microsoft. Those three stocks combine for almost 22 percent of QQQ\'s weight.\n\nShares of **Taser International, Inc.** (NASDAQ: TASR) were up more than 6 percent on Monday morning following an announcement of a new partnership with **Microsoft Corporation** (NASDAQ: MSFT).\n\nAccording to a press release, "At the International Association of Chiefs of Police annual conference in Chicago... [This] partnership agreement will bring together the global scale, technology breadth, and security commitment of both companies through the combined capabilities of the Microsoft Azure\'s cloud platform, and Windows 10 devices with TASER\'s Axon Platform and Evidence.com solution."\n\nThe partnership "will provide a security-enhanced digital evidence management experience for law enforcement in an efficient and low-cost environment." The companies "will create an integrated approach to capturing and managing evidence including ingesting, retrieving, sharing, analyzing and archiving video, sensor and other data to support law enforcement and criminal justice officials as they work toward creating safer communities."\n\nTaser shares recently traded at $23.79, up 6.3 percent.\n\nThe stock plummeted last week following an announcement from **Motorola Solution Inc** (NYSE: MSI) that the latter had entered the police body-cam space.\n\nAt the time, Oppenheimer\'s Andrew Uerkwitz told Benzinga he believes the market thinks Motorola will be used by the Chicago Police Department instead of Taser, which he said was the reason for Taser\'s sell-off.\n\nMotorola Solutions shares were down about 0.7 percent at $70 on Monday morning.\n\n  * **Microsoft Corporation** (NASDAQ: MSFT)\'s new flagship retail store in New York City will open for the first time on Monday.\n  * Microsoft\'s five story, 22,000 square foot store on iconic Fifth Avenue will rival **Apple Inc.** (NASDAQ: AAPL) flagship store that is just a few blocks away.\n  * Microsoft\'s store will showcase its tablets, PCs, Xbox, Lumia phones, augmented reality devices and other products and services.\n\nApple\'s iconic Fifth Avenue store with its unique glass cube entrance may now be overshadowed by Microsoft\'s new five story, 22,000 square foot store that will open its doors to customers for the first time on Monday. Microsoft\'s new store is located just a few short blocks away from Apple\'s store and will sport a glass faÃ§ade that allows pedestrians to glimpse inside the store. Once inside, customers can seek information and test out the company\'s wide array of offerings, including Surface Books, Lumia smartphones, Xbox hardware and games. The store will also be the company\'s only retail location to display its new $3,000 augmented reality headset, HoloLens. The large property also allows Microsoft to deploy "store inside of stores" and will feature products from its partners, including Dell. The store will also feature several "Answer Desks" which offer assistance on any Windows hardware. The Street\'s Brian Sozzi reported that Microsoft Stores COO David McAughan said that "one reason we built these stores is to showcase the first-party products we do have." The executive also said that Microsoft is "at that point in time where we think we have a real story to tell." Microsoft currently operates 111 retail stores across the world, well short of Apple\'s 456. In an email to Benzinga, Sozzi said Microsoft\'s new store is "Impressive" and he "likes the focus on services, video walls to drive in a consumer\'s eye."'
 '* _The share price of**Microsoft Corporation** (NASDAQ: MSFT) has appreciated 23.46 percent over the past month, reaching a high of $54.25 on October 26._\n  * _FBR & Co.\'s Daniel H. Ives has maintained an Outperform rating and price target of $60 on the company._\n  * _Ives believes that Nadella has made three major strategic changes over the last 18 months that have helped the company turn around._\n\n\n\nAnalyst Daniel Ives mentioned that the "three major fundamental and strategic changes" made by Nadella include realizing that the **Nokia Corporation (ADR)** (NYSE: NOK) acquisition would not be a success and taking action accordingly.\n\nIn addition, Microsoft has undertaken significant headcount reductions in order to grow free cash flow and margins, while focusing most of the company\'s resources and efforts on the cloud initiatives.\n\nIves also said that the development of "the flagship Windows 10 platform" was the third strategic move by the company.\n\nIves expressed optimism regarding Microsoft\'s "genius move" to distribute Windows 10 through free downloads, thereby aggressively wooing the developer community.\n\nIn addition, according to the FBR report, "Microsoft\'s new reporting structure should help investors better measure Nadella\'s mobile and cloud vision with a focus on Microsoft as a productivity and platform company, a core part of his grand vision laid out to employees in June."\n\nIves also expressed optimism regarding Microsoft\'s prospects heading into FY16, following the robust September quarter results, driven by cloud adoption gaining momentum among enterprises at an annual run rate of over $8 billion.'
 "Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ MSFT) shares are trading lower by $0.70 at $52.99 in Wednesday's session. Even while the market was rallying earlier in the day. shares of the software giant were under selling pressure. It is poised to end its four day winning streak that started one day before its earnings beat at $47.20, Two sessions following the beat, the issue closed at $54.25. The pair of highs from Monday ($54.32) and Tuesday ($54.37) may have signaled a temporary peak in its uncharacteristic rally. _Joel Elconin is the co-host ofBenzinga39;s #PreMarket Prep, a daily trading idea radio show._\n\nDo you like this article?

 'While earnings season is still in full swing, enough companies have released in order to provide traders with a clear picture of how the market has been performing. The third quarter has been a disappointing one for most firms, leading analysts to predict that combined earnings for S&P; 500 companies will be down -2.7 percent from the same period last year. **What Happened?** A stronger dollar has limited the success for many US firms, who have seen the greenback\'s strength eat away at their margins. Slower economic activity has also weighed on many firm\'s bottom lines and low oil prices took their toll on energy stocks. **Were There Any Bright Spots?** While this quarter\'s earnings season has painted a gloomy picture, there were some sectors that appeared to be weathering the storm. The tech sector has a particularly strong performance with **Apple Inc.**(NASDAQ: AAPL), **Microsoft Corp**(NASDAQ: MSFT) and Google\'s parent firm **Alphabet** (NASDAQ: GOOG) all showing solid growth. Airline stocks also came out on top with low oil prices boosting their margins. **American Airlines Group**(NASDAQ: AAL), **United Continental Holdings** (NYSE: UAL), **Delta Airlines** (NYSE: DAL) and **Southwest Airlines** (NYSE: LUV) saw passenger numbers increase as more people traveled at the same time that their expenses decreased. **Stocks That Rallied** While earnings reports as a whole may have missed the mark, that doesn\'t mean that investors haven\'t been reacting to guidance. Several stocks have seen huge movements over the past few days following upbeat reports. The technology and healthcare sectors have seen the largest positive swings, with several companies gaining more than 20 percent during the 24 hours following their earnings release. **NETGEAR** (NASDAQ: NTGR) beat its earnings and revenue forecast and saw its stock increase 28.87 percent on its earnings reaction date. Other impressive performances from the tech sector included a 21.29 percent increase from **Gigamon Inc.**(NYSE: GIMO) and a 20.36 percent increase from **QLogic Corporation**(NASDAQ: QLGC). In the healthcare space, **athenahealth, Inc.**(NASDAQ: ATHN) gained 26.90 percent following its earnings release and **IGI Labs** saw a 23.44 percent lift. Stocks That Sunk **Pandora Media Inc.**(NYSE: P) has been one of the biggest losers so far this earnings season as the company\'s disappointing third quarter revenue and cautionary guidance led investors to flee from the stock. Following its third quarter earnings release, shares of Pandora lost 35.49 percent. Other firms that also suffered from dismal results were **Skechers USA Inc.**(NYSE: SKX), which fell 34.29 percent and **Apollo Education Group Inc.** (NASDAQ: APOL) which lost 32.22 percent. **What Do The Swings Mean?** Big changes during earnings season can mean different things to different investors. For some, a poor result is reason to sell while for others it can be an opportunity to buy. Long term investors can use times like earnings season to buy companies that are struggling in the current environment, but that they expect to see improve in the long term. Earnings season can also be stressful as some investors may see some of their holdings decline sharply following a lackluster report. However, for a portfolio that is diversified with long term investments, the swings that earnings season brings about shouldn\'t be a cause for concern. **Separating What Matters** Some analysts believe that earnings season is a good time to take a look at which stocks are trading on verifiable strength and which have been artificially inflated by the Fed\'s easy money policies. The market\'s reaction to an earnings report could provide some insight as to whether or not a stock is a strong pick. Regardless of whether or not a company hits or misses its earnings expectations, a positive market reaction suggests that the stock will continue to perform going forward. By this logic, companies like **eBay Inc.**(NASDAQ: EBAY), **Amazon.com Inc.** (NASDAQ: AMZN) and **3M Co** (NASDAQ: MMM) are all destined to continue improving as their earnings results were met with an upbeat reaction. Companies like**Netflix, Inc.**(NASDAQ: NFLX), **YUM! Brands Inc.** (NYSE: YUM) and **Wynn Resorts Limited**(NASDAQ: WYNN) all had poor reactions. \n\n_â€¢ The **Hewlett-Packard Company (NYSE:HPQ)** spin-off that takes place next week is the next step in the company\'s turnaround plan.  \nâ€¢ Hewlett-Packard joins several other tech blue chips that are fighting to compete in the modern landscape.  \nâ€¢ FBR & Co believes that 2016 will be a critical year for these companies to demonstrate their adaptability._  \n  \nStarting next week, Hewlett-Packard will split into Hewlett Packard Enterprise and HP Inc. In a new report, FBR & Co analyst Daniel Ives discusses the future for Hewlett-Packard and several other large tech stalwarts.  \n  \n**IT spending**  \nAccording to Ives, IT spending has become very focused on particular areas of innovation in recent years. In fact, he goes so far as to call the trend in IT spending "bipolar."  \n  \nBig data analytics, cloud computing and cybersecurity have generated incredible 30-40 percent annual spending growth in recent years. On the other hand, traditional hardware, services and datacenter implementations have been struggling to simply tread water.  \n  \n**Pivotal year**  \nIves believes that it\'s time for many of the larger tech names to show that they can adapt or they will run the risk of being left in the past. "We view 2016 as a pivotal year for some of the once-dominating tech stalwarts to prove that a turnaround could be in the cards despite Everest-like growth challenges," he explains. These tech giants must demonstrate to shareholders and the rest of the world that they have viable plans to compete in the $100 billion-plus next-generation datacenter market.  \n  \n**Game plans**  \nIves outlines the primary strategy that each of these big tech companies is betting on:  \n  \nHewlett-Packard: executing the spin-off and cutting costs  \n**EMC Corporation (NYSE:EMC)**: integrating with Dell, the largest merger in tech history  \n**Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL)**: capturing share in the cloud market with 12c  \n**International Business Machines Corp. (NYSE:IBM)**: targeting new strategic initiatives in could and analytics  \n**Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO)**: transforming into a next-generation networking and security competitor  \n  \nAlthough all of these companies face a hard road ahead, Ives points out that transitions in the tech world can be successful and that rival **Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT)** has so far executed its cloud transition masterfully.  \n  \n_Disclosure: the author holds no position in the stocks mentioned._']
