News Factors Considered:
['Digital wallets and emerging payments technology were at the forefront of conversations at the 2018 Benzinga Fintech Summit in San Francisco.\n\nKarla Allen, head of digital wallets at **Walmart Inc.**(NYSE:WMT), provided insight on the industry and its future in retail.\n\n### Walmart Pay\n\nWalmart Pay is a QR code-based connection to the point-of-sale technology in which customers are able to easily purchase items with an app. \n\n"The product has been really growing and consumers like it," Allen said. "Over 20 million customers per month use the Walmart app overall, and we\'ve seen hundreds of thousands of sign up for the Walmart Pay feature each month. We\'re seeing a lot of growth there and there\'s a ton of innovation." \n\n### PayPal\n\nLast month, the retail giant announced a partnership with payments innovator **PayPal Holdings Inc.**(NASDAQ:PYPL).\n\nWith this deal, PayPal users will have the opportunity to withdraw and deposit money at any Walmart location.\n\n"We have over 5,000 stores in the U.S. and 90 percent of that population lives within 10 miles of one of our stores. This is the first time that PayPal has had a physical footprint for giving cash back from an account. We want to do more with partners to help support our customers in the way they pay," Allen said. \n\n### Scan And Go\n\nWalmart has built a similar technology to the cashierless checkouts at **Amazon.com, Inc.**(NASDAQ:AMZN)\'s Amazon Go stores.\n\n"We\'re trying to lead in customers getting in and out of the store quickly and not having to stand in line, especially during rush times like lunch time and holidays," Allen said. "This is just a new way to remove some friction, and what we find is that people are shopping with us more often because they can get out more quickly and they really love it. About 80 percent of customers use it again within 90 days."\n\nWalmart has to leverage the community for fintech advancements and startups for ideas, Allen told the Benzinga Fintech Summit. \n\n"We feel like there\'s a gap in the products and services that are being built for middle America."\n\n_Related Links:_\n\n_Execs From Ripple, Fiserv, Zelle Discuss Blockchain Payments, Instant Transfers_\n\n_With Its Latest Update, Fintech Lender Credibly Looks To Connect Capital To Even More Small Businesses_\n\n_Photo by MikeMozartJeepersMedia/Wikimedia.  _'
 'The iPhone is a relatively small device, but worries about it seem to be creating big ripples in the stock market. Meanwhile, earnings news from big box retailers also seem to be weighing on the market this morning as fresh housing data came in mixed.\n\nU.S. stocks look to be poised for another down day after worries about iPhone sales helped lead a tech selloff yesterday that appeared to taint sentiment. The Wall Street Journal reported yesterday that **Apple Inc.** (NASDAQ:AAPL) has cut production orders for the three new iPhones it unveiled in September. \n\n### Apple, Tech and the Consumer\n\nAAPL is a widely held stock with a very large market capitalization, so it can help dictate wider market sentiment. Plus, there are a host of companies that supply the tech giant, as well as those who sell their devices at the retail level, meaning that sometimes, as Apple goes, so goes the market. \n\nYesterday, the U.S. stock market opened a Thanksgiving-shortened week with plenty of red to go around. Tech short sellers in particular seemed to have something to be thankful for as the tech heavy Nasdaq Composite (COMP) declined more than 3 percent, roughly double the fall in the S&P 500 (SPX) and Dow Jones Industrial Average ($DJI).\n\nThe drubbing continued this morning with not just AAPL but all of the FAANG stocks -- **Facebook, Inc.** (NASDAQ:FB), AAPL, **Amazon.com, Inc.** (NASDAQ:AMZN), **Netflix, Inc.** (NASDAQ:NFLX), and **Alphabet Inc.** (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) -- down in premarket trading alongside chipmakers as the negative momentum kept up.\n\nThe selling appears to be part of a repricing of stocks as market participants weigh the possibility of U.S. tariffs on China rising to 25 percent if the world\'s two largest economies don\'t reach a resolution in a lingering trade dispute that has led some market participants to worry about global economic growth.\n\nOver the weekend, Vice President Mike Pence in tough talk on trade seemed to throw cold water on hopes for a deal. While Pence\'s comments could be a negotiating tactic -- especially as they come after President Donald Trump saying he might not tack on additional tariffs to Chinese goods -- for the moment they appear to be spooking investors in the tech sector as many of those companies rely on a supply chain linking the U.S. and China.  \n\nAnother ongoing geopolitical situation investors appear to be keeping an eye on is Brexit. A "hard" Brexit without an agreement in place could be a worst-case scenario that could pose challenges for the European economy in a way that might be avoided with a deal in place. \n\n### Windows Into the Housing Market\n\nAlthough this week\'s data calendar is fairly light overall, it\'s a veritable full house when it comes to housing market data. \n\nThis morning, October housing starts came in slightly under expectations while building permits were a bit stronger than 3rd-party consensus, according to Briefing.com. On Wednesday, a fresh snapshot on existing home sales and a mortgage applications index are due to be released. \n\nWhen you consider the recent volatility among home builder stocks, plus the weaker guidance offered by DIY giant **Home Depot Inc.** (NYSE:HD) when it released earnings last week, this week\'s housing data may be worth watching. This morning, HD competitor **Lowe \'s Companies, Inc. **(NYSE:LOW) reported revenue and adjusted earnings per share that beat expectations, but it lowered its sales forecast for the year and its shares were down more than 6 percent in premarket trading. \n\nApparently contributing to negative market sentiment yesterday was November\'s National Association of Home Builders/Wells Fargo Housing Market Index, which came in at 60, well under the Briefing.com consensus expectation of 68. Home builders are facing higher costs for labor, land, and commodities. And rising interest rates that are increasing mortgage costs, perhaps causing some potential home buyers to shy away.\n\nA decade ago, as the great recession unfolded, the housing market was arguably ground zero. While we find ourselves in a very different world today, with a very different set of lending standards, the housing market is still "one to watch," as home spending and home equity tend to help drive consumption.\n\nIn corporate news tied to consumers, the latest results from **Target Corporation** (NYSE:TGT) seemed to weigh on sentiment this morning as the retailer reported lower-than-forecast earnings.Its shares fell over 9 percent on the news. Meanwhile, it was a different story with **Kohl \'s Corporation **(NYSE:KSS), where net income beat expectations. Still, KSS shares were down around 11 percent in premarket trading. Although KSS raised its adjusted earnings per share guidance, investors apparently had been hoping for more.\n\n### Perhaps not a Panic\n\nIf you\'re the type of person who likes to see the brighter side of things, drink from glasses that are half full, and look for silver linings, then a takeaway from Monday\'s U.S. stock market could be that the selling didn\'t appear to be panic selling.\n\nAlthough yields on government bonds fell, there wasn\'t a complete melt down there, as you might expect if panicked traders were buying bonds hand over fist. Still, while the stock selling seemed orderly, it was not inconsequential. And with stocks dropping, it\'s perhaps not surprising that Wall Street\'s main fear gauge, the Cboe Volatility Index gained ground, indicating investors expect increased volatility.\n\nVolume was on the light side in trading in SPX and COMP companies. Light volume can often exacerbate moves up or down. \n\n  \n**Figure 1: Home Builders Struggle.  **Home builders have been on the decline recently, as shown by the S&P Homebuilders Select Industry Index ($SPSIHO), as they face higher costs for labor, land, and commodities. And rising interest rates that are increasing mortgage costs, perhaps causing some potential home buyers to shy away, or to come to market with less buying power.

Past performance does not guarantee future results._  \n\n### **Slow Overseas Growth and U.S. Inflation Eyed**\n\nLooking back at recent Fed comments, which arguably sounded a little more dovish, a couple of factors come to mind. First there\'s this month\'s rally in the dollar, which tends to move higher when the Fed tightens rates and could be one factor behind Europe\'s recent woes. Another thought is that inflation here at home just doesn\'t seem too frightening. Core consumer prices rose 2.1 percent year-over-year in October, the government said earlier this week. That was actually down from September. Meanwhile, the last Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) price index, which the Fed watches closely, showed core inflation holding steady at 2 percent. The next PCE data is due the week after Thanksgiving, and investors might want to consider giving it a close look for any sign of change. As for the dollar index, it drew back slightly early this week to 96.21, well below last week\'s highs above 97.50.\n\n### **Global Dividends Hit Record**\n\nGlobal dividends rose to a record in Q3 as continued strength in the world economy boosted corporate profitability, according to a report based on the latest Janus Henderson Global Dividend Index. The latest quarterly study showed that headline global payouts rose 5.1 percent to a Q3 record of $354.2 billion. In the United States, headline dividends rose 9.1 percent to an all-time record $120 billion. Payouts in Canada, Taiwan and India also hit records. Meanwhile, in China, dividends returned to growth. Janus Henderson is forecasting headline growth in dividends of 8.5 percent for 2018, bringing the total amount of payouts to $1.359 trillion. \n\nAccording to Ben Lofthouse, head of global equity income at Janus Henderson, "2018 may be a volatile and more challenging year for stock markets, but steady profit growth means dividends should continue to make steady progress." However, the pace of corporate profit expansion may be slower next year than previously thought given the late stage of the economic cycle, he said. Still, "growing profits and strong cash flow mean that dividends should continue to be well supported, and so investors seeking an income from their shares should feel confident about the year ahead." \n\n_Information from TDA is not intended to be investment advice or construed as a recommendation or endorsement of any particular investment or investment strategy, and is for illustrative purposes only.

Amazon is among a small handful of interested buyers and is competing with bidders such as **Apollo Global Management LLC** (NYSE:APO), **KKR & Co Inc** (NYSE:KKR), **Blackstone Group LP** (NYSE:BX), **Sinclair Broadcast Group Inc** (NASDAQ:SBGI) and Tegna, traded as **GANNETT CO INC.** (NYSE:TGNA), CNBC said, quoting sources familiar with the situation. \n\n### Why It\'s Important\n\nAmazon has already paid $50 million for the rights to broadcast live football on Thursday nights and is looking to build out its live sports portfolio, Axios said. This could be seen as a strategy to differentiate itself from **Netflix, Inc.** (NASDAQ:NFLX) which has shown minimal to zero interest in live sports.\n\nAmong the nearly two dozen regional sport networks owned by Disney is YES, which broadcasts Yankees games along with 44 teams across baseball, basketball and hockey leagues, CNBC said. The YES network could wind up being sold in a separate transaction from the other networks, according to the report. \n\nAccording to Variety, regional sports networks are a "hugely profitable" business and are considered must-have channels for local sports fans. \n\n### What\'s Next\n\nRegardless of who buys the properties from Disney, the media empire is obligated to divest its sports network within 90 days of the closing of the Fox deal, Axios said. The company\'s sports network properties are worth around $20 billion, according to the story. \n\n_Related Links:_\n\n_It\'s Early, But Here\'s How NFL Games Are Doing On Amazon Prime Vs.

 "Planning a Thanksgiving feast is no different from managing a portfolio: plan ahead and proceed with confidence.\n\n### Step 1: The Game Plan\n\nBefore running out to buy the Thanksgiving turkey and all the sides, it's important to take some time to create a game plan.\n\nThese are some of the basic questions you should be able to answer before hitting up the grocery store:\n\n  * How many people are coming.\n  * Are there any food allergies or restrictions?\n  * Is there enough room at the table for all the food and guests?\n  * Is there enough room in your fridge and freezer?\n  * Do you have all the necessary equipment like knives and cutting boards?\n\n\n\nOnce these questions are answered, it's time to move on to menu planning. A standard Thanksgiving feast includes a turkey, several sides and dessert. A host can feed eight people for under $50 at **Walmart Inc** (NYSE:WMT), according to CNBC, and those on a budget may want to avoid higher-priced grocery retailers like **Amazon.com, Inc.** (NASDAQ:AMZN)'s Whole Foods.\n\nNow it's safe to move on to the grocery store with a list in hand of everything that's needed.\n\n### Step 2: Food Safety\n\nTurkeys can be cooked multiple ways, including smoking, grilling, roasting and deep frying. Regardless of the method, food safety is paramount. The Food Safety and Inspection Service says a turkey is safe to eat when a food thermometer registers 165 degrees Fahrenheit in the thickest part of the breast.\n\nStuffing a turkey is not recommended, as it could block heat from cooking the interior of the turkey properly -- or raw turkey droppings could drip into the stuffing. Those who choose to stuff a turkey need to understand that stuffing similarly needs to reach an internal temperature of 165 degrees.\n\nMore than 1 million people are sickened each year in the U.S. by salmonella bacteria with more than 23,000 hospitalized, according to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\n### Step 3: Logistics\n\nMost kitchens are not equipped with sufficient cooking space to tackle an entire Thanksgiving menu at the same time. Different food items require different cooking temperatures, which creates a problem for those who leave all the work for the last minute. YouTuber Alex French Guy Cooking recommends hosts begin preparing for a feast as soon as the Monday prior to Thanksgiving. \n\nSticking to a proper schedule days in advance ensures a host spends more time with their friends and family and less time hiding away in the kitchen.\n\n### Step 4: Inspiration\n\nLooking for inspiration? Looking to wow your guests with a unique feast? You'll find a selection of cooking videos below for beginner, intermediate and advanced cooks looking to impress their guests.\n\n### The Turkey\n\n  * Beginner: Food Wishes' Chef John prepares a technique-free, ultra-simple turkey.\n  * Intermediate: BBQ Pit Boys prepares an apple cider-brined turkey roasted on the grill.\n  * Intermediate: Franklin Barbecue's Aaron Franklin offers a step-by-step guide to smoking a turkey.\n  * Advanced: Chef Tom of ATBBQ.com prepares a turducken: a turkey stuffed with chicken and duck.\n  * Something Different: an award-winning grand champion BBQ pitmaster prepares an Indian-inspired tandoori turkey.\n\n\n\n### The Sides\n\n  * Binging with Babish explains the basics of classic Thanksgiving sides.\n  * Tasty prepares 12 different sides with a twist.\n  * Gordon Ramsay prepares a pork, sage and apple stuffing.\n  * Jamie Oliver covers everything you need to know about making gravy from start to finish.\n\n\n\n### Dessert\n\n  * Twisted's list of 11 Thanksgiving desserts includes classics like apple pie.\n  * Tasty offers 20 fall desserts that are appropriate for a Thanksgiving feast.\n  * Imperial Sugar prepares a beautiful-looking pumpkin trifle with cranberry orange sauce.\n\n\n\n_Peas, the 2018 National Thanksgiving Turkey, prior to its pardon by President Donald Trump Tuesday.

 '**Amazon.com, Inc.**(NASDAQ:AMZN)\'s Amazon Web Services announced a new service for robotics developers Monday. \n\n### What Happened\n\nRoboMaker is intended for developers that are testing and deploying robotics applications, according to Amazon. \n\n"AWS RoboMaker extends the most widely used open source robotics software framework, Robot Operating System (ROS), with connectivity to AWS services including machine learning, monitoring and analytics services to enable a robot to stream data, navigate, communicate, comprehend and learn," the company said. \n\n### Why It\'s Important\n\nRobots are quickly penetrating consumer life and performing tasks ranging from house chores to pipeline inspections, Amazon said. Those tasks are accomplished with instructions made in software applications that depend on sensor data and control actuators. \n\n"While it sounds simple in theory, developing, testing and deploying intelligent robotics applications is difficult, time-consuming and demands a diverse set of hard-to-acquire skills," the company said. \n\nRoboMaker addresses this with an integrated software and services set and allows developers to begin with a single click in AWS, Amazon said. \n\n"AWS RoboMaker provides pre-built functionality to support robotics developers during their entire project, making it significantly easier to build robots, simulate performance in various environments, iterate faster and drive greater innovation," AWS RoboMaker general manager Roger Barga said in a statement. \n\n### What\'s Next\n\nAWS RoboMaker is now available in Ireland and certain parts of the U.S. such as Virginia and Oregon, and will expand to more regions next year, Amazon said. \n\nAmazon shares were up 5.28 percent at $1,581.33 at the close Monday. \n\n_Related Links:_\n\n_Morgan Stanley: Why Retailers Should Continue To Worry About\'The Amazon Effect\'_\n\n_Report: Amazon Makes A Play For Disney\'s Regional Sports Networks_\n\nWendy Robbins and Karen Paull are the co-creators of "The Marijuana Show," a popular series on its third season that can be streamed on **Amazon.com, Inc.**(NASDAQ:AMZN)\'s Prime Video -- and a fourth season is in the works. \n\n"The Marijuana Show" is often referred to as the cannabis industry\'s "Shark Tank," with a group of contestants seeking funding for new products and services in the marijuana industry.\n\nOver three seasons, the show has offered over $20 million in funding to successful entrepreneurs, according to Robbins and Paull, who co-host and co-produce the show.\n\nThe two are much more than the women behind one of the most successful reality TV projects centered around cananbis. Benzinga recently spoke with Karen and Wendy about "The Marijuana Show"; their latest project, the "Legalize It" documentary; and their new hemp product line, Club Hemp.\n\n### Careers Before \'The Marijuana Show\' \n\nRobbins and Paull have been included in Cannabis Business Executive\'s Top 50 Most Important Women in the Cannabis Industry.\n\nPrior to launching "The Marijuana Show," Robbins attended The Juilliard School, co-starred in "Homemade Millionaire" with Kelly Ripa on **Discovery Communications** (NASDAQ:DISCA)\'s TLC and mentored inventors to pitch products on HSN. She co-invented The Tingler head massager and wrote the bestselling book "Why Marry A Millionaire? Just Be One!"\n\nPaull holds a bachelor of fine arts in acting from the University of California, Santa Barbara and a master of fine arts in acting from San Francisco State University and a bachelor of arts in sociology from UCSB. She was vice president of sales at the online photo service Snapfish and part of the executive team when the company was acquired by **HP Inc**(NYSE:HPQ) in 2005.\n\nRobbins and Paull have their own stories about how they became involved with cannabis. Robbins left home when she was 14 and sold weed to earn money.\n\n"Funny enough, I didn\'t use the product because money was what I needed," she said.\n\n"Friends were dying of cancer and the more I researched, the more I realized that cannabis and CBD oil was saving lives."\n\nRobbins used her skills as a director, writer and producer to start making documentaries to promote cannabis. Now she uses the drug to "relax, laugh, to expand consciousness, to be playful."\n\nPaull\'s first interaction with pot was in college. "I found cannabis to be the most natural anti-anxiety and relaxation fit for me," she said.\n\n### Club Hemp\n\nAside from their production projects, Robbins and Paull are entrepreneurs who co-founded Club Hemp with two contestants from the third season of "The Marijuana Show," hemp farmer Luke Johnson and CBD/formulation expert Heather Lawrence. Club Hemp started as a joint venture between Robbins and Paull\'s Tingle Global Media, Luke\'s Cloud Co. and Heather\'s Restore Skin Balance.\n\nClub Hemp recently launched a line of CBD-based products for both people and pets, with Robbins and Paull developing the branding and graphics for the line.\n\nCBD is projected to be a $22-billion industry in 2022, Paull said. \n\n"There are hundreds of companies cropping up, yet we feel we have the competitive advantage, with access to thousands of deals through our show," she said. "We are able to handpick the best of the crop. In my opinion, we have the next **Procter & Gamble Co **(NYSE:PG) for the cannabis industry." \n\n### Why A Legalization Documentary? \n\nRobbins and Paull are firm believers that marijuana has to be legal on a federal level in the U.S. so anyone who needs it can access it easily. \n\n"While cannabis is legal in some states, you can\'t cross state lines without the threat of being arrested or fined. We want to encourage our politicians to legalize it on a federal level and deschedule or reschedule it from a Schedule 1 drug, because a patient should have the right to cannabis along with the freedom to travel with it," Paull said. \n\nThe two said they hope their movie will have an impact on politicians with the ability to change marijuana policy.\n\nThe filmmakers intend to screen the film in Washington, D.C. so politicians understand the medical benefits of cannabis and the futility of the drug war, Robbins said, adding that it affects minorities 7-to-1 over white people. \n\n"Lives are destroyed for a plant," she said. \n\n### Cannabis Access A \'Human Rights Issue\'\n\n"Legalize It" shares the stories of people who need cannabis because they are fighting cancer or other diseases for which the drug is used. The film depicts the struggle to access cannabis, which "has become a human rights issue," Paull said. \n\nRobbins said: "Cannabis caused zero deaths. It\'s time to legalize it. This 30-minute film shares emotional curated conversations with moms, professional athletes, vets and former prohibitionists-turned-advocates to cause a dialogue and a vote to legalize." \n\nThe two are touring the country with the documentary and working on another while on the road.  \n\n"Our films are always about ending the stigma, stopping the futile war on drugs, the misinformation and lies to tell the truth; through integrity, we intend to save lives one story at a time," Robbins said. \n\n_Related Links:  _\n\n_Acreage Holdings Acquires Michigan Cannabis Real Estate Portfolio _\n\n_Additional Late-Stage Study Confirms Efficacy, Safety Of GW Pharma\'s Epidiolex _\n\n_Photo courtesy of "The Marijuana Show." _\n\nFollowing **Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.** (NASDAQ:AMD)\'s announcement surrounding the availability on both **Amazon.com, Inc.** (NASDAQ:AMNZ)\'s Amazon Web Services and **Microsoft Corp.**(NASDAQ:MSFT)\'s Azure, the company\'s instance count is expected to accelerate, according to KeyBanc Capital Markets. \n\n### The Analyst\n\nAnalyst Weston Twigg reiterated a Sector Weight rating on Advanced Micro Devices; a Sector Weight rating on **Intel Corp.** (NASDAQ:INTC); a Sector Weight rating on **NVIDIA Corp.** (NASDAQ:NVDA); and an Overweight rating on **Xilinx, Inc.** (NASDAQ:XLNX) with a $90 price target. \n\n### The Thesis\n\nIntel\'s Skylake remains strong in the cloud data center ecosystem, Twigg said in a Sunday note. (See his track record here.) \n\nThe company recently added eight regions to its repertoire, increasing its penetration to 96 percent of AWS, Azure and **Alphabet Inc.**(NASDAQ:GOOGL) (NASDAQ:GOOG)\'s Google Cloud, the analyst said. \n\nNvidia added seven regions, including its latest Volta processor, Twigg said.\n\nDespite the addition of only one region this year, Twigg said he anticipates four new beta program completions from Xilinx as well. \n\nKeyBanc\'s Instance Tracker shows the penetration of processor types, Twigg said.\n\n"We expect INTC to remain the dominant processor type, but we see significant runway for AMD as it benefits from strong customer pull as well as competitive price and performance; we believe AMD could exit 2019 with over 15-percent server CPU share, up from around 1 percent currently."\n\nNvidia should continue to expand across regions and is showing early traction with its new T4 processor, the analyst said. \n\n"XLNX remains well-positioned to gain additional share as beta programs conclude, and we remain positive on its long-term growth potential in the cloud." \n\n### The Price Action\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices shares dropped 0.46 percent to $19.29 at the time of publication on Monday.\n\n_Related Links:_\n\n_Baird Downgrades AMD:\'Expectations And Valuation Are High\'_\n\n_Stifel Raises AMD Price Target By 80%_\n\nThe holiday shopping season kicked off with Black Friday, which raked in record online sales of $6.22 billion, up 23.6 percent year-over-year, according to Adobe Analytics data. \n\nThis should bode well for **Amazon.com, Inc.**(NASDAQ:AMZN), which has bulldozed its way to e-commerce dominance and arguably edged some brick-and-mortar retailers out of business.\n\n### Leading The Retail Pack\n\nThe  company\'s influence on the retail sector was further confirmed by data released by FactSet. In its  weekly earnings insight,  the firm said Amazon would be responsible for more than 50 percent of the year-over-year earnings growth among S&P 500 retailers in the holiday quarter.\n\nThe retail and food and staples industry groups are expected to report earnings growth of 15 percent in Q4. The internet and direct marketing retail sub-industry -- one of13 retail sub-industries -- will lead the way, with an estimated 69.4-percent growth, according to FactSet. \n\n_**Source:** FactSet_\n\nAmazon is expected to report the highest earnings growth within the internet and direct marketing retail sub-industry.\n\nAs a corollary of the stellar growth, Amazon would be the single biggest contributor to the earnings growth of retailing and foods and staples retail companies if the projection proves true. \n\nIf Amazon\'s earnings were excluded, the earnings growth of these companies would fall from 15 percent to 6.8 percent, according to FactSet. \n\nThe consensus estimates for the December quarter call for roughly 160-percent year-over-year earnings growth for Amazon to $5.55 per share, and more muted 18.8-percent sales growth to $71.81 billion, according to the Yahoo database.\n\nAfter hitting a $1-trillion market cap earlier this year, Amazon\'s shares have pulled back along with the broader market since October. The stock is still up 28.4 percent year-to-date.\n\nAmazon shares were trading more than 4 percent higher at $1,563.19 at the time of publication Monday. The **SPDR S &P Retail **(NYSE:XRT) was up 1.45 percent to $45.53. \n\n_Related Links:_\n\n_A Perspective On The Recent Meltdown In FAANG Stocks_\n\n_Amazon HQs Are Coming To The East Coast_\n\nOnline Black Friday sales increased over 23 percent year-over-year, CNBC reported, citing data from Adobe Analytics.\n\nSmall Business Saturday was set to reach $3 billion in sales, while Cyber Monday is expected to produce a new record of $7.8 billion, an 18-percent increase from 2017.\n\n### The Analyst\n\nRaymond James analyst Aaron Kessler and KeyBanc Capital Markets analyst Edward Yruma reviewed Black Friday shopping trends among some of the most popular names in retail.\n\n### E-Commerce\n\nE-commerce sales have increased roughly 14 percent in the third quarter of 2018, according to Department of Commerce research, Kessler said in a note.\n\n"Based on the data, we maintain our positive bias on **Amazon.com, Inc.**(NASDAQ:AMZN)\'s offerings and **Alphabet Inc** (NASDAQ:GOOGL) (NASDAQ:GOOG) shares."\n\n"We would note that the holiday season sales are generally occurring earlier in the quarter, and we have seen a slowdown the last couple of years from the strong Thanksgiving weekend sales. We expect additional data points on Cyber Monday over the next couple of days as well."\n\n**Adobe Inc.**(NASDAQ:ADBE) reported 25.3-percent growth on Thanksgiving and Black Friday, while **Mastercard Inc.**(NYSE:MA) revealed an increase of 9 percent year-over-year, according to Raymond James.\n\nAmazon\'s sales surpassed last year\'s within the first nine hours on Black Friday, the company said. \n\n### Brick-And-Mortar\n\nOverall Black Friday traffic appeared strong compared to years past for retailers like **Walmart Inc.** (NYSE:WMT), **G****ap Inc.**(NYSE:GPS)\'s Old Navy**** and **Urban Outfitters, Inc.**(NASDAQ:URBN) said KeyBanc\'s Yruma.\n\n"Based on our observations, we believe the holiday season is off to a mixed start in our coverage," the analyst said.\n\nInitial data suggest softness at many physical retailers and lower Thanksgiving and Black Friday traffic, Yruma said. The shift to e-commerce and broadening of the sales holiday timeline weighed on initial holiday season results, he said.\n\n"From a sector perspective, we have a more positive outlook for underlying trends at select dollar/discount retailers, where we believe underlying trends are stronger and e-commerce competition is more muted."\n\nHome furnishing trends appear troublesome, while toy brands and leisure sectors performed in line with analyst expectations, according to KeyBanc. \n\n_Related Links:_\n\n_Best Buy Posts Strong Earnings Just In Time For Black Friday: The Sell-Side Reacts_\n\n_Black Friday Shopping Schedule: Everything You Need To Know_\n\nAfter a record-breaking Black Friday, the Cyber Monday online holiday shopping event is in full swing.

Companies like **Target Corporation** (NYSE:TGT) and **Best Buy Co Inc**(NYSE:BBY) offer free shipping for all orders, but **Walmart Inc** (NYSE:WMT) and**Kohl \'s Corporation** (NYSE:KSS) require minimum purchases of $35 and $25, respectively, to be eligible for free shipping.\n  * Get 15 percent off at Target. Target is offering 15 percent off hundreds of thousands of items on Target.com, and Target REDcard users can get an additional 5 percent off.\n  * Earn Kohl\'s Cash. Kohl\'s has extended its Black Friday Kohl\'s Cash promotion through Cyber Monday, so shoppers get $15 in Kohl\'s Cash for every $50 they spend.\n  * Avoid the **Apple, Inc**(NASDAQ:AAPL) Store.

"This is the first time this government has introduced back-to-work legislation, and the message it sends to employers is troubling," the statement said. It also quoted the president of the Canadian Labour Congress Hassan Yussuff as saying that the "right to strike is an integral part of the collective bargaining process."\n\nPossibly to bring the impact of the strikes closer to to the government, the rolling walkout was extended into the capital of Ottawa Friday, according to press reports.\n\nAt the same time, the union again said, in essence, that its rolling strikes are not having any impact.\n\nDownload it today\n\nIn a counter-statement to Canada Post\'s declarations about a significant backlog of parcels that can\'t be cleared until January 2019, CUPW President Mike Palacek, in the company\'s prepared statement released Friday morning, said that "Canada Post seems to have convinced Trudeau that Christmas wouldn\'t come without back-to-work legislation. But the mail was moving, and people know it. People have been getting their mail and online orders delivered."\n\nWhile there are salary disputes in the standoff between the CUPW and Canada Post--the contract covering the union expired Saturday--the growing demands put on the work force by ecommerce is also a key point of contention.\n\nThe Trudeau government has appointed yet another mediator in the dispute. Palacek, in the union statement, said the negotiator should stay, but more importantly, "the government can direct Canada Post to negotiate fairly.They said all options are on the table, what happened to th at one?"\n\nThe legislation is still before the House of Commons, with press reports saying the Senate is in position to act on it over the weekend if it is passed by the Commons.\n\n\\---------------\n\nIn Europe, **Amazon.com, Inc**. (NASDAQ:AMZN) logistics centers in Germany and Spain were hit with strikes, according to Reuters.\n\nIn Germany, about 620 workers struck at facilities in Bad Hersfeld and Rheinberg.\n\nWorkers at Amazon\'s biggest warehouse in Spain, San Fernando de Henares, walked off the job on Friday and will also strike on Saturday. Unions said between 85 and 90 percent of staff were taking part in the industrial action.\n\nReuters said the German workers start at 10.78 euros ($12.23) per hour. It did not give a figure for the Spanish workers.\n\nWant more content like this? Click here to Subscribe'
 'The all stars of the 10-year bull market in U.S. stocks have been the so-called FANG group: **Facebook, Inc** (NASDAQ:FB), **Amazon.com, Inc.** (NASDAQ:AMZN), **Netflix, Inc.** (NASDAQ:NFLX) and **Alphabet, Inc.** (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL).\n\nWhile these four massive tech stocks led the market higher in recent years, they have also led it lower in the past three months.\n\n### Fall\'s Fall\n\nEach of the four FANG stocks is down at least 14 percent since late August compared to about a 7 percent decline for the S&P 500. Bank of America analysts Justin Post, Nat Schindler and Akshay Bhatia said in a Nov. 26 note they\'re still seeing rotation out of FANG stocks, but the companies\' growth fundamentals remain relatively strong.\n\nThe primary near-term concerns for FANG investors have included margin pressures, regulatory headwinds, slowing revenue growth and rising costs. Post said the FANG stocks remain dominant within their respective industries, however, and Bank of America sees only a 10 percent chance of a U.S. recession within the next year.\n\n### Recession Looming?\n\nConsensus analyst estimates suggest the average revenue growth among the FANG stocks will drop from 32 percent in 2018 to just 22 percent in 2019, but the overall consensus 2019 revenue growth estimate for the S&P 500 is just 6 percent.\n\nPost said investors are certainly right to be concerned on the potential impact a recession could have on FANG stocks within the next few years.\n\nDuring the 2008-2009 recession, tech sector earnings multiples compressed to as low as around 13 times. Regulatory concerns have already driven the 2020 estimated earnings multiple of Facebook and Alphabet close to the overall market average, eliminating the premium valuation these stocks have enjoyed for years.\n\n### Buy The Dip\n\nBut while market volatility and economic cycles are unpredictable, Post says FANG fundamentals are still impressive relative to the rest of the market.\n\n"Despite recent stock weakness, core fundamentals such as growing video viewership and online shopping are intact, and we continue to like the group on a relative growth basis," Post said.\n\nBank of America has the following ratings and price targets for the FANG group:\n\n  * Alphabet: Buy rating, $1,350 target (both share classes).\n  * Facebook: Buy rating, $190 target.\n  * Amazon: Buy rating, $2,000 target.\n  * Netflix: Buy rating, $440 target.\n\n\n\n_Related Links:_\n\n_Nomura\'s Case For Adding Square To The FANG Trade_\n\n_Jim Cramer And Bob Lang\'s 2013 FANG Call Was A Home Run_\n\nSmartphones were a strong driver of Cyber Monday sales, according to online shopping data  from **Adobe Inc**(NASDAQ:ADBE) Analytics.\n\n### Record Sales\n\nCyber Monday sales are estimated at $7.9 billion, a record performance and also the biggest online shopping day of all time in the U.S., Adobe said. This marks a 19.7-percent year-over-year increase.\n\n"Sales coming from smartphones hit an all-time high of $2 billion and we saw a significant spike in the buy online, pickup in-store trend," John Copeland, Adobe\'s head of marketing and customer insights, said in a statement. \n\nIn comparison, online sales on Thanksgiving Day and Black Friday reached $3.7 billion and $6.2 billion, respectively.\n\nOnline sales from Nov. 1 to Nov. 26 grew by 19.9 percent to $58.5 billion, with each day generating more than $1 billion in sales. \n\nSmartphone sales during Cyber Monday came in at $2.1 billion in 2018 compared to $1.4 billion in 2017, or 48.1-percent growth, according to Adobe. \n\nOverall, the mobile category -- comprising smartphones and tablets -- accounted for 51.4 percent of site visits and 34 percent of revenues, making the 2018 Cyber Monday the first in which more than half of site visits came from mobile devices, Adobe said.\n\n### Higher Online Conversions For Physical Stores\n\nThe blending of the online and offline retail experience was evident, as  retailers  with physical stores saw 28-percent higher conversions online, Adobe said.\n\nOnline purchases with in-store pickups over the shopping weekend surged a record 50 percent. \n\nSales at **Walmart Inc**(NYSE:WMT), **Target Corporation**(NYSE:TGT), **Best Buy Co Inc**(NYSE:BBY) and **Kohl \'s Corporation **(NYSE:KSS) as well as online retailer **Amazon.com, Inc.**(NASDAQ:AMZN) remained strong on Black Friday and into the weekend, CNN reported,  quoting analysts.\n\n### Top Sellers\n\nThe following results are based on Adobe Analytics\' survey. \n\n  * **NINTENDO LTD/ADR**(OTC:NTDOY)\'s Nintendo Switch.\n  * Little Live Pets.\n  * Rockstar Games\' "Red Dead Redemption 2."\n  * LG TVs.\n  * Drones (DJI, Air Hogs, Sky Viper).\n  * **Dell Technologies Inc**(NYSE:DVMT) laptops.\n  * FurReal Pets.\n  * Amazon Echo devices.\n\n\n\nThe record Cyber Monday sales are seen as a function of a vibrant economy, which is chugging along at an above-trend pace, and a strong job market. The demise of some retailers could also be benefiting the remaining players in the sector. \n\n_Related Links:_\n\n_Tuesday\'s Retail Earnings Roundup: Red Performance Across The Board _\n\n_Cyber Monday Gives E-Commerce ETF A Modest Boost_\n\nWithin the continuing downward trend afflicting the market at large, the core of the volatility remains squarely among the performance tech names. October-November loses of anywhere from 12 to 20 percent in **Apple Inc.**(NASDAQ:AAPL), **Amazon.com, Inc.** (NASDAQ:AMZN) and **Alphabet Inc.**(NASDAQ:GOOGL) have dragged the Nasdaq composite down into correction territory.\n\nWhen the market is volatile, it\'s always a good idea to keep an  eye on insider trading activity for a perspective from the c-suite. While these transactions may have taken several months prior, it can give a sense of whether there\'s a lot of buying or selling occurring in a specific stock\'s executives and largest investors.\n\nUsing Finscreener\'s Insider tools, we can get a sense of just how much pressure has been on these tech names over the past 3 months. First, just to get a general sense of the insider buying and selling activity, let\'s take a look at all of the mega-cap stocks in the S&P 500, ordering them by number of sales transactions in the last three months.\n\nAs you might expect, selling has dominated in the mega-cap space, with only two names, **JP Morgan Chase & Co.** (NYSE:JPM) and **Mastercard Inc.** (NYSE:MA), seeing any insider buying. Also in line with expectations is the preponderance of tech names on the list, with the aforementioned Apple, Amazon and Alphabet appearing high on the list alongside **Microsoft Corporation** (NASDAQ:MSFT), **Intel Corporation** (NASDAQ:INTC) and the long-suffering **Facebook, Inc.**(NASDAQ:FB).\n\nWe can take a more comprehensive look at the selling pressure in a few of these names by searching their tickers in the insider trades tool. We\'ll start with the leader in insider selling, Facebook.\n\nHere\'s a drill down of all the insider sales of Facebook over the last six weeks specifically.\n\nAs you can see, we have more than can fit in a page. Regardless, the amount of high-level personnel, like COO Sheryl Sandberg, departing VP Colin Stretch and chief product officer Christopher Cox, unloading shares certainly fits the narrative of Facebook\'s recent performance.\n\nNext, let\'s take a look at the previously trillion-dollar companies Apple and Amazon. Rather than go off of the chart, we can view a broader range of insider transaction analytics by looking at each company\'s quote page and selecting the "insider" tab, which will look like this.\n\nWhile both companies have seen outsized selling pressure over the last three- and twelve-month periods, Apple has seen some confidence in net purchases from company COO Jeffrey Williams and Principal Accounting Officer Chris Kondo.\n\nOn the other hand, Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos reduced his exposure several time over at the end of October, with 36 individual sale transactions that day. We can filter all of his transactions by selecting his name in the list of the last 15 insider transactions on the right.\n\nInsider selling by itself isn\'t a signal. It\'s important to take the data in context with long-term buying and selling trends, and to remember that the vast majority of insider transactions will be a relative drop in the bucket. That said, the scarcity of buying confidence within these companies certainly doesn\'t inspire confidence in a potential tech-driven December rally.\n\n_Finscreener is a content partner of Benzinga._\n\n**Microsoft Corporation** (NASDAQ:MSFT) briefly passsed**  Apple Inc.** (NASDAQ:AAPL) as the world\'s most valuable company Monday. \n\nApple has been on a staggering trajectory in the decade since the iPhone was released, and in the process made Microsoft look like a technology company of the past. A quick comparison of the companies\' retail stores at a local mall usually shows the divergence in consumer inerest in the brands; Microsoft simply failed to capitalize on the mobile revolution.\n\nThis makes Microsoft valuation move even more remarkable -- marking the first time since 2010 that the company is valued higher than Apple -- and could potentially reignite the conversation surrounding one of technology\'s biggest rivalries.\n\nSo how did Microsoft quietly stage an epic comeback?\n\n### Nadella Steps In\n\nCEO Satya Nadella deserves a great deal of credit. When he took over in 2014, the executive said he wanted to focus on subscription-based business and the cloud.\n\nMicrosoft\'s cloud-computing unit Azure has grown at a blistering pace; it\'s up 76 percent annually and remains the biggest competitor to **Amazon.com, Inc.** (NASDAQ:AMZN)\'s AWS.\n\nMicrosoft is one of the few technology companies that emerged relatively unscathed from the recent sell-off in tech stocks. \n\nApple\'s valuation has been in a freefall since passing the $1-trillion mark in August, and shares have fallen 22 percent after the issuance of relatively weak first-quarter guidance and despite Cupertino\'s Q4 earnings beat.\n\nApple\'s decision to stop reporting iPhone unit sales was a notably unpopular move among investors and prompted fear of a sales slowdown.\n\nConversely, Microsoft reported a healthy Q1 earnings beat Oct. 24, and issued strong Q2 commercial sales guidance, projecting 19-percent growth year-over-year. The company\'s shares are up over 4 percent since its last earnings report and are now up 24-percent year-to-date.\n\nWhile Apple quickly regained the title of the world\'s most valuable company, Microsoft is now nipping at its heels and it begs the question: what would the business world look like if the company had more of a mobile edge? \n\n_Related Links:_\n\n_Time For Apple\'s Stock To Enter A \'Period Of Digestion,\' Guggenheim Says_\n\n_Morgan Stanley: Buy The Dip In Apple_\n\n_Photo courtesy of Microsoft.  _\n\nThe up and down of the market so far this week seems to have been a tale of two types of trade.\n\nExcitement about a potentially bumper holiday shopping season goosingdomestic trade at retailers helped spark a rally yesterday. But the mood seems more somber this morning as tensions about trade between the United States and China have come back to the forefront.\n\nPresident Trump told the Wall Street Journal in an interview that it was "highly unlikely" that he would grant a Chinese request to hold off on raising tariffs on $200 billion in Chinese goods to 25 percent from the current 10 percent. He also reiterated his threat to put duties on the rest of Chinese imports not currently subject to tariffs, the newspaper reported. \n\nIf the U.S. goes ahead with the tariffs on additional goods, Trump said **Apple Inc.**(NASDAQ:AAPL) iPhones and laptops imported from China could be subject to duties, the newspaper reported. That news comes on the back of already existing concerns about iPhone sales. AAPL shares were down more than 1.8 percent in pre-market trading.\n\nTrump\'s comments are the latest salvo in a trade dispute between the world\'s two largest economies that has dragged on for months and fueled worries about global economic growth. Those fears have helped put downward pressure on both the equities market and oil prices in recent days.\n\nOil is down again this morning, and with the substantial declines in prices recently, it might be worth watching to see if Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell makes any mention of the fall in crude in a speech Wednesday or if central bankers mention falling prices in minutes scheduled for release the same day. It\'s possible that Wall Street could interpret mention of falling oil prices as a dovish sign from the central bank.\n\n### Retail-Fueled Gains\n\nOn Monday, the shopping wasn\'t confined to just online retailers. Bargain hunters seemed to be buying in the stock market too. Every S&P 500 (SPX) sector closed in the green yesterday, led by consumer discretionary stocks as investors appeared to be positive on the sector as post-Thanksgiving sales continued into Cyber Monday. \n\nAccording to a late-morning press release yesterday, **Adobe Systems Incorporated**(NASDAQ:ADBE) was projecting that spending on Cyber Monday would hit $7.9 billion by the end of the day to make it the biggest U.S. online shopping day in history. \n\nDespite steep online competition, brick-and-mortar isn\'t dead. On Thanksgiving Day and Black Friday, shopper visits to traditional retail stores declined just 1 percent for the combined two-day period compared to last year. On Black Friday alone, there was a 1.7 percent drop in traffic versus 2017, according to ShopperTrak. "The fact that the combined shopper visits remained almost the same this year compared to the last three years proves that the notion of Black Friday not being popular anymore is a myth," Brian Field, senior director of global retail consulting for ShopperTrak, said in a press release. "Based on the Black Friday traffic data, retailers are in for a successful holiday season."\n\nWith retailers racking up sales online and in stores, it perhaps wasn\'t surprising to see the consumer discretionary sector up nearly 2.6 percent, leading the other 10 S&P 500 sectors in percentage gains.\n\n### Tech, Oil Bounce Too\n\nInformation technology shares took the runner-up ribbon for gains Monday, helped by bounces in **Facebook, Inc.** (NASDAQ:FB), **Amazon.com, Inc.** (NASDAQ:AMZN), AAPL, and **Alphabet Inc.**(NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL).\n\nYesterday\'s bounce in tech shares, and the wider U.S. market, after last week\'s selling may also have to do with some bargain hunting as investors appear to be trying to get a feel for whether the overall downward bias in stocks may be coming to an end.  \n\nStocks weren\'t the only asset to bounce on Monday. Oil prices also rose. The bounce may have been helped by bargain hunting and by a seemingly more favorable attitude toward assets perceived to be riskier. U.S. government bond yields rose as investors apparently exited Treasuries as the perceived need for more defensive assets waned. Wall Street\'s fear barometer, the CBOE Volatility Index (VIX), dropped.\n\nBut uncertainty doesn\'t seem to have fully left the market, as the VIX remains elevated. It\'s been bouncing around the 20 mark of late, which is higher than what we\'ve seen for much of this year but is in the ballpark of historical norms. Although it fell yesterday, with tensions about trade heading into the G20 meeting, it might not be surprising to see it inch back up.\n\n**Figure 1: Nearing a Bottom?  **There has been plenty of selling in the stock market in recent weeks, as shown by this chart of the S&P 500. CFRA, an investment research firm, thinks the selling may be nearing a conclusion (see below.) Data Source: S&P Dow Jones Indices. Chart source: The thinkorswim® platform from TD Ameritrade. _For illustrative purposes only. Past performance does not guarantee future results._  \n\n### **Selling Seen Near Conclusion**\n\nThe current stock market selloff may be nearing a conclusion, investment research firm CFRA said in a note on Monday. Based on the average next-12-months price-to-earnings ratio for the five most recent market declines in excess of 5 percent, the S&P 500 would need to fall just 1.4 percent more from last week\'s close to bottom around 2596. But if the market needs to fall to the average P/E ratio from the last 10 market declines before bottoming, the index would have to fall to 2321. "The magnitude of the ultimate decline will largely reflect the consensus conclusion surrounding the ongoing trade dispute, which represents the keystone in this arch of agita," the firm said. "At CFRA, we don\'t see a recession on the horizon and think there is a very good chance that this selloff is near its conclusion."\n\n### **Second Q3 GDP Estimate**\n\nTomorrow, the government takes its second swing at gross domestic product numbers, with its second estimate of Q3 GDP. The figures are expected to show robust annualized growth of 3.6 percent, according to a Briefing.com consensus. That would be slightly ahead of the 3.5 percent recorded in the first estimate, so it probably wouldn\'t be enough to sway the Fed\'s thinking on the pace of economic growth and the potential need to rein it in with more hawkish policy. But it may be worth watching for whether the number comes in ahead of expectations or if the prior reading is revised substantially higher. If either of those two scenarios occurs, it could weigh on stocks as investors might worry that the Fed might act more aggressively to keep the economy from overheating.  \n\n### **Bright Spot for Housing**\n\nIf you were like many on Wednesday and focused on heading out for the Thanksgiving holiday, you could be forgiven if you missed some news from the housing market. There\'s been a drum beat of less-than-stellar housing news in recent days, so Wednesday\'s better-than-expected existing home sales data for October may have come as a welcome surprise. Sales rose month-over-month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.22 million, beating the Breifing.com consensus expectation of 5.2 million. But the housing market isn\'t out of the woods, as "even with the October increase, the level of sales remains at levels from late 2016 as higher mortgage rates and a limited supply of lower-priced homes weigh," Briefing.com said. \n\n_TDAInformation from TDA is not intended to be investment advice or construed as a recommendation or endorsement of any particular investment or investment strategy, and is for illustrative purposes only.

By some estimates, Cyber Monday sales will generate close to $8 billion.\n\n"Target and Amazon.com were pulling out all the stops, offering free delivery with no minimum order requirement and bombarding shoppers with promotional emails. Companies had logged $531 million in sales as of 10 a.m. ET, Adobe Analytics found," according to Reuters.\n\n### Why It\'s Important\n\nIBUY tracks the EQM Online Retail Index, which requires member firms to generate 70% of their sales from online venues. Traditional brick-and-mortar retailers such as **Target Corp.** (NYSE:TGT) and **Macy \'s Inc.** (NYSE:M) are not among IBUY\'s 42 holdings.\n\nNone of IBUY\'s holdings command weights of more than 3.7 percent, so the ETF isn\'t dominated by **Amazon.com Inc.** (NASDAQ:AMZN) as are so many standard Internet ETFs. Although Amazon is the largest U.S.-based e-commerce company, it\'s not even a top 10 holding in IBUY. **Ebay Inc.** (NASDAQ:EBAY), the second-largest online retailer, is IBUY\'s sixth-largest holding at a weight of 3.38 percent, according to issuer data.\n\n"In another estimate, Mastercard SpendingPulse forecast a 25 percent jump in e-commerce sales to at least $3 billion, based on sales via the Mastercard payments network and estimates for other payment forms such as cash and check," Reuters reports.\n\n### What\'s Next\n\nIBUY debuted in April 2016, so this isn\'t the ETF\'s first dance with the holiday shopping season. In 2016, IBUY fell 2.20 percent in the fourth quarter. Last year, the fund posted a fourth-quarter gain of 10.80 percent. IBUY is up 71 percent since inception.\n\n_Related Links:_\n\n_A Dependable Dividend ETF_\n\n_Leave Volatility Behind With This ETF_'
 'Fed Chair Jerome Powell takes center stage Wednesday when he steps to the podium at the Economic Club of New York. With other Fed speakers recently sounding a bit more dovish, the question is whether Powell might say anything that reinforces hopes for a less active central bank in 2019. \n\nGoing into Powell\'s noon ET speech, the market seems to have a more positive tone after consecutive strong finishes Monday and Tuesday. While there\'s still a lot of emotion hanging over the Street ahead of Powell, optimism might be growing a little going into weekend trade talks between the U.S. and China. When it comes to market sentiment, tariffs still rule the roost. Just about every big move recently has been related to China, one way or the other, so watch for potential volatility ahead of that big weekend meeting.\n\nFrom a data standpoint early Wednesday, the government left its estimate for Q3 gross domestic product (GDP) unchanged at 3.5 percent. New home sales for October also bow this morning. Tomorrow afternoon brings Fed minutes from its November meeting.\n\nThere was also some earnings news late yesterday and early today. **Tiffany & Co.** (NYSE:TIF) shares got crushed Wednesday in pre-market trading after the company\'s same-store sales rose but missed Wall Street analysts\' estimates. This probably reflects a drop in tourism and a strong dollar more than anything, so it\'s not necessarily time to panic about the high-end consumer. \n\nOn a more positive note, shares of business software firm **Salesforce.com, Inc.** (NYSE:CRM) heated up with an 8 percent jump in pre-market trading after the company not only easily beat analysts\' estimates on earnings, but, perhaps more importantly, delivered a strong outlook.\n\n### Powell Speech Takes Center Stage\n\nThough his speech has an academic-sounding title, "The Federal Reserve\'s Framework for Monitoring Financial Stability," many investors are waiting to hear if Powell addresses the subject on so many minds: The Fed\'s interest rate thoughts heading into 2019.\n\nWhile there\'s no guarantee of Powell saying anything meaningful about rate policy, it\'s probably a good idea to monitor his speech and see if he echoes any of the more dovish comments made by Fed Vice Chair Richard Clarida, who on Tuesday said the Fed funds rate is "much closer" to neutral than it was three years ago when rates began going up from essentially zero. No one at the Fed has pinpointed what exact number "neutral" might be, but Clarida said it\'s important that the Fed be "data dependent" about future moves.\n\nPowell last talked about "neutral" roughly two months ago when he said current rates (which are the same now as they were then) were "a long way" from neutral. Some analysts think that was one factor that helped lead to the sell-off in October.\n\nAt this point, the futures market puts nearly 80 percent odds on a fourth 2018 rate hike next month, but odds of another hike next year have come down a lot in recent weeks. While the Fed\'s "dot-plot" on Dec. 19 will probably be the best way to get insight into what might happen in 2019, there\'s a chance Powell could provide some kind of preview. Just remember, though, that it\'s possible that the speech might not touch on any policy thoughts.\n\nAlso, consider listening for any observations he makes about inflation. Remember, Powell hasn\'t really addressed this topic much since crude oil prices cratered over the last month. A weaker crude environment could mean less price pressure, perhaps meaning less pressure on the Fed to raise rates.\n\n### Perking Up\n\nClarida\'s dovish remarks Tuesday might have helped change the market\'s tone a bit after early weakness related to tariff worries and the announcement that **United Technologies Corporation** (UTX) would be broken up into three separate companies. UTX, which is a Dow Jones Industrial Average ($DJI) component, fell 6 percent on the news and didn\'t come back much as the day advanced.\n\nAnother $DJI stock that took an early beating Tuesday was **Apple Inc.** (NYSE:AAPL), which fell after President Trump threatened tariffs on the iPhone. However, unlike UTX, AAPL shares did claw back to recover most of their losses during the session. That doesn\'t negate the fact that AAPL is down about 25 percent from its all-time highs (see more below), and has lost hundreds of billions in market-cap since an earnings report that disappointed many investors.\n\nThough tariff worries seemed to take a bite out of AAPL Tuesday, the rest of the market got a lift from what sounded like bullish comments on China from Larry Kudlow, a White House economic advisor. As the administration prepares for Saturday\'s dinner date featuring President Trump and Chinese President Xi, Kudlow told the media, there\'ve been talks "at all levels" between the two governments. \n\nThere was also some decent-looking data Tuesday, with consumer confidence for November falling just slightly to 135.7. That was a little above the average analyst estimate, and down just a tad from the 18-year high it reached in October. If the market\'s correction since early last month is having an impact on consumers, it\'s hard to tell from Tuesday\'s numbers.\n\nAnother reflection of consumer confidence was Cyber Monday sales, which hit $7.9 billion, the largest ever, according to Adobe. That was up 19 percent from a year ago. Also, 165 million Americans shopped over the long weekend, Adobe said, about 1 million more than analysts had expected. Consumers do appear to be holding up their end.\n\nMost of the FAANGs didn\'t seem to get much of a lift from the consumer news, with only **Netflix, Inc.** (NASDAQ:NFLX) making decent gains Tuesday. Some of that FAANG weakness probably helps explain why Nasdaq (COMP) barely moved even while the S&P 500 (SPX) and $DJI posted moderate gains. However, some of the retail stocks, including **Macy \'s Inc.** (NYSE:M) and **Target Corporation** (NYSE:TGT), posted strong finishes. For the most part, retailers appear to be doing well.\n\nBasically, it looks like a waiting game as Wednesday begins. Action might be slow ahead of the Powell speech, and unless Powell says something the market interprets as meaningful,  it might be hard to get much more direction until the weekend meeting between Trump and Xi. \n\n**Figure 1:  Mind Your 10s and 2s. **The spread between the 10-year Treasury yield and the 2-year Treasury yield spent 6 months of the year--from Feb-Aug--on a narrowing path, from over 75 basis points down into the teens. It widened out to about 35 basis points, but a Fall 2018 equity meltdown, combined with a Fed that has continued its path of incremental hikes to the Fed funds rate, has seen the spread between 10s and 2s narrow again in recent weeks.

Many large companies took advantage of record-low borrowing costs earlier in the 2010\'s to take on debt for acquisitions, capital improvements, stock buybacks and other spending programs. In the last decade, the amount of corporate bonds outstanding nearly doubled to $9 trillion, from $5.5 trillion, The New York Times said Tuesday. A lot of that debt has relatively low ratings, meaning there\'s higher odds of default. Now there\'s concern that as interest rates rise and the economy appears to be slowing in some sectors, some major companies might have trouble paying back what they borrowed. This includes a few big blue-chips, and also the energy sector, where a lot of the shale-drilling companies are highly leveraged. As The New York Times pointed out, when big companies start having trouble with debt, it can sometimes become harder for ordinary Americans to borrow in the future. \n\n### **Race for Market Cap**\n\nBack in August and September, when the stock market was flying high on its way to record heights for all the major indices, two companies--Apple (AAPL) and **Amazon.com, Inc.** (NASDAQ:AMZN)--made headlines of their own by reaching the lofty $1 trillion market cap. While it\'s always possible we could see a sharp shift in fortunes, at this point those headlines seem a little quaint considering the worse than 20 percent dives each stock has taken since. In fact, one school of thought suggests that AMZN and AAPL reaching $1 trillion might have represented a signal that the market as a whole had become overbought and helped trigger the breakdown in October and November. At this point, another tech name, **Microsoft Corporation** (NASDAQ:MSFT), has nearly caught up with in valuation with AAPL, and AMZN is well behind both. As of midday Tuesday, MSFT\'s market cap of $822.62 billion was just inches behind AAPL\'s $823.18 billion. AMZN was way back with $771.71 billion. This reflects in some sense the fact that MSFT has performed far better than the other two since the market peak in early October, with shares down less than 8 percent since then.\n\n### **Nifty 50 Repeat? Not So Fast**\n\nIt\'s only been two months since AAPL, AMZN, **Facebook, Inc.** (NASDAQ:FB) and other FAANG stocks fell off a cliff on their way into bear market territory, but already some analysts are wondering if the momentum that carried them and helped the rest of the market might be behind us. Some are even comparing them to the so-called "Nifty 50" stocks that dominated the market rally in the 1960s and 1970s before losing steam. It\'s a bit early to draw those kind of conclusions, however. Just two months ago many of these names were still among the market\'s strongest, and all of them remain viable companies, some with billions of social media users or phone buyers. That\'s why comparisons to the 2000-2002 Internet crash don\'t seem fair, considering that many of the high-flying tech companies then didn\'t really have any earnings or sales to speak of. \n\n_TDAInformation from TDA is not intended to be investment advice or construed as a recommendation or endorsement of any particular investment or investment strategy, and is for illustrative purposes only.

 'The National Academies of Science has identified seven core research areas that it said could help DOT determine possible changes to truck size and weight. (_Photo: Truckstockimages.com_)\n\nIn 2015, the Department of Transportation (DOT) released a long-awaited truck size and weight study. The report, heralded by safety groups and panned by industry groups such as the American Trucking Associations (ATA) and shippers, did not provide any clarity on the matter of larger or heavier trucks. Instead, it kicked the can down the road.\n\nDOT essentially conducted a four-year study to determine there wasn\'t enough data to move forward with changes to truck size and weight regulations.\n\n"At this time, the department believes that the current data limitations are so profound that the results cannot accurately be extrapolated to predict national impacts," said then-DOT Under Secretary Peter Rogoff. "As such, the department believes that no changes in the relevant truck size and weight laws and regulations should be considered until these data limitations are overcome."\n\nAt the heart of the matter is twin 33-foot trailers, which would add 10 feet of cargo capacity to the current 28-foot trailers.\n\nFast-forward three years and debate is still ongoing over the potential benefits - or harm - that 33-foot trailers could do. A new report from the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (NAS) sheds little light on whether longer trailers are warranted, but it does outline the steps DOT should take to collect the data the agency said it was lacking in 2015.\n\nLearn more today\n\nAsked by DOT to create a roadmap forward, NAS developed a report that identifies 7 core research projects that could assist in drawing more definitive conclusions on longer trucks. A committee for NAS estimates it would take between $4 million and $6 million and four to six years to complete these "core research tracks."\n\nDOT is not obligated to follow NAS\' recommendations.\n\nThose tracks are:\n\n  * Development of a truck traffic, weight, and configuration database from nationwide weigh-in-motion installations and other sources.\n\n  * Development of a freight market model for estimating the effect of changes in truck size and weight regulations on shippers\' choices of freight mode and truck size.\n\n  * Development of pavement analysis methods for heavier axle limits, multiaxle groupings, and alternative tire and suspension types.\n\n  * Development of a model of the relationship of bridge deterioration and service life to vehicle loads.\n\n  * Comparative evaluations of crash risks of alternative configurations based on traffic and crash data.\n\n  * Development of protocols for evaluating the performance of configurations with simulation, track testing, and field trials.\n\n  * Measurement of relationships between frequency of overloads and enforcement methods and level of effort.\n\n\n\n\nCompleting these research programs, NAS said, would "strengthen the federal and state governments\' capabilities to project impacts of changes in truck regulations. Of equal importance, the research could reveal opportunities to improve safety and productivity and control highway costs, regardless of whether truck size and weight limits are changed."\n\nIndustry groups and shippers have long pushed for longer tractor-trailer combinations that they say will increase productivity without jeopardizing safety.\n\nThe Truck Safety Coalition, a joint group of Parents Against Tired Truckers and Citizens for Reliable and Safe Highways, claims that the longer 33-foot doubles would actually extend 17 feet longer than a current 53-foot tractor-trailer and have worse crash rates. Citing a study by the Multimodal Transportation & Infrastructure Consortium (MTIC), it said that double-trailer configurations have an 11 percent higher fatal crash rate than single-trailer trucks. The group also cites a 22-foot longer stopping distance and increased damage to roadways as negative impacts.\n\nIn a letter to Congress earlier this year, more than two dozen interest groups reiterated some of the Truck Safety Coalition\'s arguments against longer trailers.\n\n"Increasing the length of double tractor-trailers by five feet per trailer would result in a configuration that is approximately the size of an 8-story building. These massive trucks would not only be more difficult for other motorists to maneuver around and co-exist on the roadways with but would also be more difficult for truck drivers to operate," the group\'s letter stated. "For example, \'double 33s\' traveling at 60 miles per hour require an additional 22 feet to stop compared to existing twin-trailer configurations. Considering crashes in which a truck rear-ends a passenger vehicle have gone up 82 percent from 2009 to 2015, any extra stopping distance will make such crashes more likely and increase the severity of the crashes that are already occurring. Claims that longer trucks will improve safety ignore the facts and defy reality.\n\n"Despite misleading assertions to the contrary, longer or heavier trucks will not reduce the number of trucks on our roads or the number of truck vehicle miles traveled or the number of truck crashes," the letter continued. "In fact, the U.S. Department of Transportation found that any reduction in the number of trucks due to a truck size increase would be offset within a year of implementation. An increase in trailer size or weight limit would divert freight from the rails to trucks, as the latter industry will have a greater capacity to ship via longer or heavier trailers - thereby disrupting and diminishing intermodal efficiency."\n\nAmericans for Modern Transportation, an advocacy group that includes **XPO Logistics Inc  **(NYSE:XPO), PODS, Manufacture Alabama and Truck Trailer Manufacturers Association, **FedEx Corporation** (NYSE:FDX), **United Parcel Service, Inc.**(NYSE:UPS), WYRC, and **Amazon.com Inc** (NASDAQ:AMZN) and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce among its members, countered the arguments by noting that extending trailers from 28 to 33 feet would save 3.1 billion vehicle miles traveled per year, result in 4,500 fewer truck crashes, and save 52.3 million hours due to less highway congestion.\n\n"With fewer miles traveled, the LTL industry would use less fuel -- conservative estimates show a 255-million-gallon reduction in annual diesel fuel use. That is a lot of crude that is not drilled, transported, refined, transported again and burned to power the LTL fleet," it claimed. "Furthermore, a five-foot extension for twin trailers, with no change in the weight limits, would result in 2.9 million fewer tons of carbon emissions."\n\nWant more content like this?

(See his track record here.) \n\n  * AWS CEO Andy Jassy suggested the company\'s new software applications will include machine learning and artificial intelligence components, Sebastian said. AWS intends to use the technology to reduce cost and friction in ML workloads, such as Amazon Elastic Inference, which can cut GPU costs by 75 percent.\n  * Blockchain technology is now "on Amazon\'s radar," the analyst said. The company announced Amazon Managed Blockchain, a fully managed service that supports Hyperledger Fabric and Ethereum frameworks. This can be used across multiple industries, including health care, mortgage issuance, supply chain and automotive, Sebastian said. \n  * The company introduced Lake Formation, which should reduce the time required to build a data lake from months to days, the analyst said. AWS already has more than 10,000 data lakes in its AWS S3 storage service, and the new offering could increase the accessibility of advanced machine learning and artificial intelligence applications, he said. \n  * AWS discussed its progress in hybrid cloud initiatives, including leveraging the partner ecosystem to support hybrid workloads and a strategic focus moving forward, according to Baird. \n\n\n\n### Price Action\n\nAmazon shares were down 0.25 percent at $1,673.57 at the close Thursday. \n\n_Related Links:_\n\n_Amazon Web Services Announces Cloud Robotics Development Service_\n\n_Victor Anthony Says Buy Into Amazon\'s Weakness, Raises Target To $2,225_\n\n_Photo courtesy of Amazon.  _']
