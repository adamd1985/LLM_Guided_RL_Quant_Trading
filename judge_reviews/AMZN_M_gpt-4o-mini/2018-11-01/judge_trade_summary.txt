Based on the provided market data and news, predict the LLMâ€™s decision:
News Factors Considered:
['The bullish case for **Alphabet Inc** (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) is based on seven factors, according to Wedbush.\n\n### The Analyst\n\nWedbush\'s Michael Pachter initiated coverage of Alphabet with an Outperform rating and $1,350 price target.\n\n### The Thesis\n\nPachter highlighted the seven positive attributes that he said support a bullish stance on Alphabet. (See the analyst\'s track record here.) \n\nGoogle and its products are considered to be the "default gateways" to the entire internet. This concept extends beyond the core search platform to include the primary global email platform (Gmail) and one of the best video streaming platforms (YouTube).\n\nAlphabet\'s ability to gather a trove of information from users implies it can offer superior ad targeting abilities and better value to advertisers.\n\nGoogle\'s total advertising business generated $106 billion for the one-year period ending June 30, making it a leader in the category. For instance, Google\'s ad business is more than double the size of **Facebook, Inc.** (NASDAQ:FB), which had ad revenue over the same time period of $47.8 billion.\n\nGoogle boasts the ability to control the content and ads consumers see "after they search for any term at any time at any location and on any device."\n\nChrome\'s 67.9-percent market share on desktop and 57.4-percent market share on mobile devices is not only "significantly" higher than its peers, but gives it the ability to show users more relevancy than ever before.\n\nAndroid phone shipments for 2018 are estimated to come in at 1.23 billion, more than five times that of iOS devices. Android\'s global market leadership adds another dimension to its data collection efforts.\n\nGoogle could become a major winner in the smart speaker category, as **Amazon.com, Inc.** (NASDAQ:AMZN)\'s devices appeal mostly to its own Prime members. "Billions of consumers" are up for grabs by Google.\n\n### Price Action\n\nAlphabet shares were down 2.78 percent at $1,096.20 at the time of publication Thursday.\n\n_Related Links:_\n\n_What\'s Next For FANG Stocks After Recent Weakness?_\n\n_Google Home Is Gaining Ground On Amazon Echo_\n\n_Photo courtesy of Google.  _\n\nEarlier this year, the Department of Defense announced a winner-take-all competition in order to select a cloud computing company to host its sensitive information. \n\nSome of the initial contenders included**Amazon.com, Inc.**(NASDAQ:AMZN), **Microsoft Corporation**  (NASDAQ:MSFT), **Oracle Corporation**  (NYSE:ORCL), **International Business Machines Corp.** (NYSE:IBM) and **Alphabet Inc.** (NASDAQ:GOOGL) (NASDAQ:GOOG)\'s Google.\n\n### The Competition\n\nThis week, Google withdrew from the Joint Enterprise Defense Initiative, or JEDI, competition, as it said it conflicts with the company\'s principles.\n\n"We are not bidding on the JEDI contract because first, we couldn\'t be assured that it would align with our AI Principles," a Google spokesman told Bloomberg. "And second, we determined that there were portions of the contract that were out of scope with our current government certifications."\n\nIBM then filed a protest, claiming the bid process restricts competition, according to Bloomberg. Oracle has also protested the process. \n\n"Throughout the yearlong JEDI saga, countless concerns have been raised that this solicitation is aimed at a specific vendor. At no point have steps been taken to alleviate those concerns," Sam Gordy, IBM\'s general manager for federal and government industries, said in a blog post. \n\n### Why It\'s Important\n\nThe project could alter traditional business models for the Pentagon and transition several users to a commercial cloud, according to Bloomberg. The JEDI project could threaten companies that have yet to enter the cloud space or have been slow to develop, but provide tailwinds for companies that help organize software for big cloud computing entities. \n\nThe $10-billion deal includes a two-year base contract with the potential for an eight-year renewal.\n\n### What\'s Next\n\nDespite several protests, the Defense Department is firm in its decision to select one company and one company only, as multiple players "could prevent DoD from rapidly delivering new capabilities and improved effectiveness to the warfighter that enterprise-level cloud computing can enable," according to Bloomberg.\n\nThe deadline for interested companies is Friday, according to the Defense Department.\n\nAt this point, Amazon is considered a clear frontrunner. \n\n_Related Links:_\n\n_Infographic: A Journey To The Cloud_\n\n_The Rise Of An Empire: All The Ways Amazon Grew Even Bigger Under Trump\'s Nose_\n\nInvestors may find it surprising that out of a portfolio of more than 4,000 stocks, only 28 percent are showing "any form of an uptrend," according to Piper Jaffray\'s Craig Johnson.\n\n### The Analyst\n\nJohnson, a managing director and senior technical research analyst, was a guest on CNBC\'s "Worldwide Exchange" Thursday.\n\n### The Thesis\n\nThe stock market is flashing a concerning signal at a time when it is attempting to regain its all-time highs, Johnson told CNBC.\n\nNot only are a fewer number of stocks showing upside momentum compared to prior rallies, but a much smaller number of stocks are responsible for a majority of the upside in the broader market.\n\nThe "fab five" stocks -- **Alphabet Inc** (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL), **Amazon.com, Inc.** (NASDAQ:AMZN), **Apple Inc.** (NASDAQ:AAPL), **Microsoft Corporation** (NASDAQ:MSFT) and **Netflix, Inc.** (NASDAQ:NFLX) -- account for around 80 percent of the performance of the Nasdaq 100 index year-to-date, Johnson said. It\'s "not healthy" to have so few stocks driving the overall market, he said, adding that an earnings miss from just one of the five names could cause a setback and correction. \n\n"From my perspective, I don\'t like to see the market this narrow," Johnson said. \n\n_Related Links:_\n\n_A Peek Into The Markets: US Stock Futures Fall Ahead Of Economic Data_\n\n_25 Stocks Moving In Thursday\'s Pre-Market Session_\n\n_Photo of Apple \'s Cupertino, California headquarters by Daniel L.

VZ is first up, slated for before market open on Tuesday, Oct. 23 and then T reports before the open Wednesday, Oct. 24. \n\nIt\'s been an eventful year for telecom. T\'s acquisition of Time Warner closed in June, the long anticipated merger of **T-Mobile US Inc.** (NASDAQ:TMUS) and **Sprint Corp.** (NYSE:S) was finally announced, although it\'s still pending regulatory approval, and the industry continues to work on deploying 5G technology, the next generation of wireless connectivity standards. \n\nAs VZ and T run limited 5G trials and prepare to launch networks in the future, there\'s still a lot of uncertainty and plenty of hype regarding the significantly faster new wireless standard. Either way, it\'ll take some time for investors to get a better idea of pricing amid competition, costs to build and maintain, and so on. \n\nBetween some of the mega-mergers and acquisitions, as well as progress on 5G, there\'s plenty for management to discuss on earnings calls. \n\n### Verizon Earnings and Options Activity\n\nVZ is expected to report adjusted EPS of $1.19 on revenue of $32.51 billion, according to third-party consensus analyst expectations. In the same quarter last year, VZ reported adjusted EPS of $0.98 on revenue of $31.72 billion. The impact of tax reform is a big driver of the expected earnings growth for the quarter. Once you get out to 2019, analysts are widely expecting EPS growth in the low-single digits for the foreseeable future. \n\nOutside of its acquisition of Yahoo a few years back, which was still relatively small, VZ hasn\'t gone after major media and entertainment acquisitions. As such, investors have been largely focused on the company\'s wireless and wireline results. \n\nWhen the company last reported, it added 531,000 retail postpaid phone accounts, while analyst consensus is for that to come in just under 550,000 when the company reports tomorrow. Overall, analysts are expecting wireless revenue to come in at $22.7 billion. \n\nAnalysts are widely expecting mixed results in the company\'s wireline business. Total FiOS TV subscribers are expected to decline slightly, while FiOS Internet is expected to exhibit modest growth. \n\nIn other news, VZ has continued to take steps to shave expenses. The company recently reported they have offered voluntary severance to 44,000 employees, which would add costs in the short-term, but save money over the longer run per management\'s plan.\n\n**Bouncing Back.** After hitting a 2018 low of $46.09 in early May, VZ has steadily risen since then and is up back into positive territory for the year, up 2.56 percent year to date. Since mid-August, the stock has been trading in a narrower range between $53 and $56.  Chart source: thinkorswimÂ® by TD Ameritrade. _Not a recommendation. For illustrative purposes only. Past performance does not guarantee future results._\n\nAround VZ\'s earnings release, options traders have priced in a 2.6 percent stock price move in either direction, according to the Market Maker Move indicator on the thinkorswimÂ® platform. Implied volatility was close to the middle of the road, at the 53rd percentile as of this morning. \n\nIn short-term options trading at the Oct. 26 weekly expiration, calls have been active at the 55 and 56 strike prices, while activity on the put side has been concentrated at the 54 and 55 strikes. At the Nov. 2 expiration next week, the 55-strike call had volume of 10,331 contracts during Friday\'s session, much higher than any other strike price at that expiration. This was also new positioning as open interest was only 5,891 contracts at the time. \n\nAt the Nov. 16 monthly expiration, recent volume has been heavier on the call side, mostly concentrated at the 55-strike call, with a decent amount of activity at the 57.5 strike as well. For puts, most of the recent trading has been at the 52.5 and the 55 strikes, right around the money.  \n\n_Note: Call options represent the right, but not the obligation, to buy the underlying security at a predetermined price over a set period of time. Put options represent the right, but not the obligation to sell the underlying security at a predetermined price over a set period of time._\n\n### AT&T Earnings and Options Activity\n\nFor Q3, T is expected to report adjusted EPS of $0.94, up from $0.74 in the prior-year quarter, on revenue of $45.65 billion, according to third-party consensus analyst estimates. Revenue is projected to increase 14.8 percent year over year. \n\nThis will be the first full quarter since the Time Warner Acquisition closed, so investors are likely to be looking for more information about how everything is progressing so far. But a mega-merger like that is naturally going to take some time. The company also just announced it would acquire AppNexus, a programmatic advertising company. \n\nOutside of this year\'s acquisitions, focus will fall on the company\'s core business. When T last reported, it had 3.8 million net wireless subscriber additions, 3.1 million in the U.S., primarily connected devices and prepaid phones, and 756,000 adds in Mexico. Postpaid phone net additions remained subdued last quarter, with 46,000 in the U.S.\n\nDirecTV Now had 342,000 net adds and management said that its total video customer base had stabilized. The company also added AT&T WatchTV last quarter, so that\'s another area that investors will likely be looking for more info on how well the new services is doing. \n\n**Tough 2018.** T trended down at the start of the year and since May the stock has mostly been bouncing around between $31 and $34. So far this year, shares are down 14.71 percent, lagging the S&P 500 (SPX) by a wide margin. Chart source: thinkorswimÂ® by TD Ameritrade. _Not a recommendation. For illustrative purposes only. Past performance does not guarantee future results._\n\n \n\nOptions traders have priced in a 3.3 percent stock price move in either direction around the T\'s earnings report, according to the Market Maker Move indicator. And implied volatility was at the 57th percentile as of this morning. \n\nIn short-term options trading at the Oct. 26 weekly expiration, calls have been active at the 33.5 and 34 strike prices, whereas activity on the put side has been heavier at the 33 strike, pretty much right at the money. \n\nFurther out at the Nov. 16 monthly expiration, calls have been active at the 34 and 35 strike prices, with a decent amount of activity at the 33 strike as well. Recent trading on the put side has been spread out across a range of strikes, with the bulk of the action between the 32 strike and the 34 strike. \n\n## What\'s Coming Up\n\nThis week kicks off the busiest stretch of Q3 earnings season, with major companies across sectors scheduled to report. These are just a few of the notable ones on the docket: \n\n  * **Boeing Co.** (NYSE:BA) reports before market open on Wednesday, Oct. 24.\n  * Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), **Ford Motor Company** (NYSE:F), and **Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.** (NASDAQ:AMD) all report after market close on Wednesday, Oct. 24.\n  * **Twitter Inc.**(NYSE:TWTR) reports before the open on Thursday, Oct. 25, while **Snap Inc.**(NYSE:SNAP), **Amazon.com, Inc.** (NASDAQ:AMZN) and **Alphabet Inc.**(NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) all report after the close the same day. \n\n\n\nFor an overview of what else is going on across markets, make sure to check out today\'s Market Update. \n\n_Information from TDA is not intended to be investment advice or construed as a recommendation or endorsement of any particular investment or investment strategy, and is for illustrative purposes only. Be sure to understand all risks involved with each strategy, including commission costs, before attempting to place any trade._\n\nAfter a week that went all over the place and ended up going nowhere, Monday starts with a muted tone as a host of earnings reports awaits. It\'s one of the busiest earnings weeks of the season, and info tech might hog the spotlight.\n\nLast week\'s market action, and Friday\'s in particular, gave both bulls and bears some fodder. The S&P 500 (SPX) had some dramatic ups and downs, but finished the week almost exactly where it started at 2767, which just happens to be one point below its 200-day moving average and even with its year-to-date average. This level could hold some technical significance moving forward, perhaps forming a key support point. \n\nVolatility, meanwhile, remains elevated. The VIX began the week near 19, up from September lows below 12 and perhaps signaling more possible turbulence ahead.\n\nStocks moved slightly higher in pre-market trading Monday, apparently getting a boost from the second-straight day of big gains  in China after the government there took measures to support the market and started talking over the weekend about a possible tax cut, according to media reports. The Shanghai Composite rose 4 percent Monday. Stocks in Europe also climbed amid positive earnings and as concerns about Italy\'s economy eased slightly after a less dramatic than expected downgrade from Moody\'s. It looks like U.S. stocks might hop on for the ride, judging from action in the futures market.\n\nBefore looking at this week\'s earnings menu, a look back at Friday\'s reports seems in order. **Honeywell International Inc.** (NYSE:HON) beat Wall Street analysts\' earnings-per-share estimate and matched on revenue. **Procter & Gamble Co.** (NYSE:PG) beat estimates on both top-and-bottom lines, and PayPal (PYPL) beat earnings expectations and offered guidance a little above analysts\' forecasts. Meanwhile, **American Express Company** (NYSE:AXP) also beat expectations amid higher card member spending and increased loans. \n\nThe AXP earnings might have told investors more good news about the consumer. People seem to be out there spending money, and few if any reports--either data or earnings--conflict with that theory. The AXP results could provide more evidence.\n\nOn the earnings watch early Monday, both **Halliburton Company** (NYSE:HAL) and **Kimberly Clark Corp.**(NYSE:KMB) kept the positive results flowing as each beat Wall Street analysts\' estimates. However, Hasbro (HAS) came up a bit short.\n\n### Lots of Possible Distraction From Earnings \n\nWe\'re seeing good earnings, and at the end of the day earnings are what drive the markets. When companies like PG report good earnings and provide good guidance, that tends to be a positive thing for the market overall. Strong earnings can often cause the market to go higher, but there\'s a lot of noise right now that might be distracting some investors from company results.\n\nIt looks like several ingredients are still in the mix for volatility to continue, though the VIX fell below 19 early Monday. The relatively new wild card is the surge in Treasury yields, with any fresh meaningful rise in rates likely to pressure the market. The benchmark 10-year yield was roughly flat early Monday but still above last week\'s lows, resting at 3.19 percent.\n\nTrade worries also haven\'t gone away, so any big news on that front could move the market. And we\'re getting closer to November elections. Any headlines about candidates and their economic policies could factor into uncertainty. \n\nWhen people talk about "noise" distracting the markets, all of the items above arguably qualify. Most of those elements are domestic, but overseas issues also are in the mix. There are a lot of political situations around the world, and evidence was all over the place the last few days with China, Italy, and Saudi Arabia. Investors are starting to see little hot pockets of news that can potentially hit the market at any given time, and when you add elections on top of that, it\'s no wonder volatility moves up.\n\nMarkets are back to a more normal historical volatility level after a year or so of abnormal smoothness, and that could affect the market\'s course the rest of 2018. Some analysts say the U.S. market historically tends to rally into the end of the year after midterm elections, though that\'s something we\'ll have to wait and see about. But even if it happens, it doesn\'t seem likely to be a very clean rally. It could be uglier than normal with a lot of back and forth.\n\n### Tech, Industrial Earnings on Tap\n\nAs for earnings, there are some market leaders scheduled to report in coming days, notably from the industrials and tech sectors. Those include results from **Caterpillar Inc.** (NYSE:CAT), **Boeing Co.** (NYSE:BA), and **General Electric Company** (NYSE:GE) as well as **Microsoft Corporation** (NASDAQ:MSFT), **Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.** (NASDAQ:AMD), **Twitter Inc.** (NYSE:TWTR), **Snap Inc.**(NYSE:SNAP), and **Alphabet Inc.** (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL). **Amazon.com, Inc.** (NASDAQ:AMZN) is scheduled to report alongside these companies.\n\nIt will be interesting to see whether executives at the big multinationals have anything to say on the latest developments on international trade issues. Investors might also want to monitor major defense contractors **Raytheon Company**(NYSE:RTN) and **Lockheed Martin Corporation** (NYSE:LTM) in addition to BA to see if they predict  any impact on their business from recent tension between the U.S. and Saudi Arabia, a big arms buyer.\n\n### Eying GDP, Beige Book\n\nOn the economic, inflation, and interest rate fronts, the Fed is scheduled to release its Beige Book this coming Wednesday. Investors may want to scour the summary of anecdotal information on current economic conditions for clues as to what is guiding the thinking of monetary policy makers. Of particular interest could be any commentary about the tightness of the labor market and whether that\'s leading to rising wages. Also of possible interest would be any comments on whether the trade war with China could be putting a damper on the economy, which would run counter to the inflationary environment of strong economic performance we\'re seeing at the moment.\n\nSpeaking of the strong economy, investors are scheduled to get the first government reading on Q3 gross domestic product on Friday, Oct. 26. According to a consensus of economists, expectations are for a reading of a 3.3 percent annualized yearly growth rate. As of Oct. 17, the Atlanta Fed\'s GDPNow model estimate for seasonally adjusted annual 3Q GDP growth stood at 3.9 percent.\n\nEither of those readings would be below the 4.2 percent in Q2 but still nothing to sneeze at. Also, an easing of GDP growth would arguably lessen the pressure on the Fed to raise interest rates. While it might not actually alter the trajectory of gradual rate hikes, anything pointing to lower inflation could be a comfort to any on Wall Street who are worrying the central bank might raise rates too quickly for the market\'s comfort.\n\n  \n**FIGURE 1:** **BREACHING THE BASELINE?** The rally in the S&P 500 Index (SPX) that commenced after the February 2018 meltdown had one commonality: any temporary breach of the 200-day moving average (blue line) was short-lived. Recent moves, however, have many chart watchers on alert. SPX finishes the week right on this long-term technical indicator.  Data Source: S&P Dow Jones Indices.

Past performance does not guarantee future results. \n\n### **Rising Rates, Inflation, and Bond Investing**\n\nEven though rising rates tend to depress the prices of previously-issued bonds, in the long term, higher yields can mean strong income for bond investors over time. Outright losses in the bond market tend to be small, Jeffrey DeMaso, director of research with Adviser Investments, said in a note, pointing to the Bloomberg-Barclays U.S. Aggregate Bond Index, which has never lost more than 5 percent over a calendar year since its inception in 1976 and has only had three negative years, with 2018 potentially being the fourth. Further, intermediate-term U.S. government bonds delivered positive returns each year from 1971 to 1981 even though the yield on the 10-year Treasury rose from around 5.9 percent to more than 15.5 percent, he noted. And bonds tend to rise when stocks falter, giving them their role as a portfolio diversifier. \n\nBut rising inflation can eat away purchasing power and negatively affect the real value of bond returns. Factoring in inflation meant a much weaker performance during that 1971-1981 period, when inflation ran as high as 14 percent, DeMaso noted. Thankfully, we\'re nowhere near that right now. "Today\'s bond investor might be wary of inflation, but they absolutely shouldn\'t fear rising rates," DeMaso said. "Rather, they should welcome higher interest rates for the larger income streams they will produce over time."\n\n### **Home Affordability Crimping Sales**\n\nPart of the fallout from rising interest rates is that mortgages on homes are more expensive, along with rising costs for steel and lumber. That appears to be crimping the U.S. housing market, whether it\'s upstream in the form of building permits for future homes or downstream with the sale of existing homes. In a recent column, we noted how both housing starts and building permits data for September came in under expectations. That was followed by numbers on Friday showing that sales of existing homes came in at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.15 million units. That reflected a month-on-month decline and a miss of the 5.3 million units economists in a Briefing.com consensus had expected. \n\n"Home sales activity was pressured by the limited supply of lower-priced homes and the affordability constraints presented by higher mortgage rates," Briefing.com noted. Investors are scheduled to get another couple of peeks into the housing market on Oct. 24, with data on new home sales for September due out after a housing price index for August. September pending home sales data is due out the next day.'
 '**Paypal Holdings Inc**(NASDAQ:PYPL) reported third-quarter results Oct. 18, and the readthrough isn\'t looking all that positive for its erstwhile parent **eBay Inc**(NASDAQ:EBAY), according to RBC Capital Markets.\n\n### The Analyst\n\nAnalyst Mark Mahaney downgraded eBay from Outperform to Sector Perform and reduced the price target from $47 to $34.\n\n### The Thesis\n\nPayPal revealed a slowdown in its  eBay  Marketplaces total payment volume, excluding forex, from 5.7 percent year-over-year in Q2 to 3.4 percent in Q3, Mahaney said in the Monday downgrade note. (See his track record here.) \n\nPayPal management also mentioned anticipated softness in the eBay  Marketplace business in Q4, the analyst said. \n\nThe transition to intermediate payments through the  Adyen partnership  will be slower than planned, with sellers indicating a 40-60-percent drop in sales since the transition, in RBC\'s view. \n\nWith significant risk now seen in RBC\'s assumption that marketplace improvements will lead to significant acceleration in eBay\'s gross merchandise volume, the sell-side firm said it is reducing its estimates for the company.\n\nRBC lowered its Q4 and 2019 FY19 revenue, pro forma operating income and EPS estimates by 1 percent. The firm now anticipates 2019 revenue of $11.6 billion, pro forma operating income of $3.19 billion and GAAP EPS of $2.03.\n\nRolling forward its estimates to 2020, the firm also reduced its price target for eBay. \n\n"At the margin we are also concerned about rising **Amazon.com, Inc.**(NASDAQ:AMZN) risk -- our survey results and the company\'s aggressive infrastructure investments almost certainly suggest that the long-standing Amazon competitive risk is becoming more material," Mahaney said. \n\n### The Price Action\n\nShares of eBay were down 2.16 percent at $27.88 at the time of publication Tuesday. \n\n_Related Links:_\n\n_How to Buy eBay Stocks_\n\n_6 Analysts React To The PayPal-eBay Split_\n\n  * Morgan Stanley cut **Lowe \'s Companies, Inc. ** (NYSE:LOW) price target from $125 to $110.

 'Ecommerce giant **Amazon.com, Inc.** (NASDAQ:AMZN) reports earnings after market close on Thursday, Oct. 25. Since the start of September, the stock has pulled back almost $300 from its all-time high of $2050.50. Despite the declines, shares are still up 48.75 percent year to date, outpacing the S&P 500\'s (SPX) 1.6 percent return by a wide margin. \n\nWhen AMZN releases its Q3 results, it is expected to report adjusted EPS of $3.12, up from $0.52 in the prior-year quarter, on revenue of $57.1 billion, according to third-party consensus analyst estimates. Revenue is projected to increase 30.5 percent year over year. \n\nWhile there\'s always a lot going on at the company, analysts and investors appear to have been honed in on three areas lately: ecommerce, cloud services and advertising, which the company has been rolling out in recent quarters. \n\n### Ecommerce Operations\n\nIn Q2 2018, North American ecommerce operations generated $32.17 billion in revenue, up 44 percent year over year. That segment also had operating income of $1.84 billion, the highest of all its segments (historically, Amazon Web Services had been the bigger profit driver.) \n\nRevenue from international ecommerce operations was up 27 percent year over year to $14.6 billion. This division generated a loss of $494 million during the second quarter, smaller than the $724 million loss the year before. \n\nTomorrow\'s report should include results from 2018 Prime Day, which AMZN rolled out to more countries this year. In the past, Prime Day sales have added some variability in top and bottom-line results. This year, AMZN made extensive use of its $13.7 billion Whole Foods acquisition and tied many of its Prime Day promotions in with the grocery chain. \n\nOn tomorrow\'s call, investors might be looking for more information on future ecommerce plans as well. AMZN acquired online pharmacy PillPack this year and has also started to open cashierless stores, saying it has plans to eventually open as many as 3,000 locations in the U.S. \n\n### Amazon Web Services\n\nAmazon Web Services, or AWS, the company\'s cloud division, has long been a focus among investors and analysts as it has been the company\'s most profitable from a margin perspective. AWS revenue increased 49 percent year over year to $6.1 billion, and generated $1.64 billion in operating income, more than half of the total $2.98 billion. \n\nFor a long time, AMZN had a big lead when it came to cloud computing. But over time, competitors have expanded to offer similar services. After reports from**IBM** (NYSE:IBM) and **Microsoft Corporation** (NASDAQ:MSFT) this week, AMZN\'s report might provide a closer look at how the space continues to evolve. \n\n### Advertising \n\nAdvertising is a newer line of business for AMZN, but it\'s one that many analysts think represents a sizable opportunity for the company. While a bulk of its focus has been on selling advertising for products and services bought and sold on its site, the company has been exploring different options as well. By 2020, several analysts believe AMZN\'s advertising business will generate as much as $16 billion in revenue. \n\n**2018 Rally.** Even after its recent pullback, AMZN, charted above, is still up 48.75 percent year to date. The stock\'s increase has eclipsed both the Nasdaq 100\'s (NDX, teal line) 9.33 percent return and the S&P 500\'s (SPX) 1.66 percent return over the same time frame.

Past performance does not guarantee future results._\n\n \n\n## Amazon Options Activity\n\nAround AMZN\'s upcoming earnings release, options traders have priced in a 5.7 percent stock move in either direction, according to the Market Maker Move indicator on the thinkorswimÂ® platform. With the stock trading at $1768.70, that indicates that traders are expecting just over a $100 move in the stock. As of this morning, implied volatility is at the 81st percentile. \n\nIn short-term options trading at the Oct. 26 weekly expiration, calls have been active at the 1790 and 1800 strike prices. Puts have seen a smattering of activity spread out across a range of strikes around the money, with heavier activity at the 1770 and 1780 strikes. \n\nAt the next several weekly expirations, there hasn\'t been much activity that stands out. Further out at the Nov. 16 monthly expiration, the 1800 strike price has been active for both calls and puts, which is around the midpoint of where the stock has been trading for the past two weeks. \n\nOverall, recent trading has been leaning towards the call side, but not by much. The put/call ratio during yesterday\'s session was 0.756 with total volume of 123,003.\n\n_Note: Call options represent the right, but not the obligation, to buy the underlying security at a predetermined price over a set period of time.

Analyst estimates call for earnings of $3.12 per share on sales of $57.1 billion.\n\n### Higher Minimum Wage \'Squarely In Focus\'\n\nAmazon\'s growth in advertising, Amazon Web Services and third-party sales will be focal points of the report, D.A. Davidson analyst Tom Forte said in a preview note. (See his track record here.)\n\nThe analyst expects 27.4-percent sales growth, amounting to $55.74 billion, as sales have topped the consensus forecast in 11 of the past 14 quarters.\n\nForte anticipates a GAAP operating income of $2.1 billion, as well as an earnings per share of $3.38.\n\nAmazon Web Services sales should increase by 44 percent, he said.\n\nInvestors will likely pay close attention to Amazon\'s new $15 minimum wage, Forte said.\n\n"While we see it as an increasingly necessary move for Amazon to attract talent, expand its physical footprint, and make a statement, the financial impact will be squarely in focus this quarter."\n\nForte reiterated a Buy rating on Amazon with a $2,450 price target\n\n### Market Research\n\nAmazon\'s worldwide e-commerce revenue is expected to increase by more than 28 percent this year to reach $394.23 billion, according to eMarketer data. The company\'s domestic e-commerce revenue should grow over 29 percent to $258.22 billion.\n\nAmazon\'s global net digital ad revenue is expected to surge 143 percent to reach $5.83 billion, giving Amazon a 2.1-percent share of the market on a global scale, eMarketer said.\n\nOther notable statistics from the research include:\n\n  * Worldwide mobile ad revenue growth of 235 percent.\n  * 88.7 million U.S. viewers of Amazon Prime Video.\n  * 40.7 million U.S. Amazon Echo owners.\n\n\n\nAmazon\'s stock traded around $1,737.94 Wednesday afternoon. Shares are up 46 percent year-to-date.\n\n_Related Links:_\n\n_Morgan Stanley Bullish On Amazon\'s New Automated Stores_\n\n_Amazon Threat Turns JPMorgan Bearish On Valvoline_\n\n_Photo courtesy of Amazon._\n\nA mixed earnings picture early Wednesday seems to have U.S. stocks searching for direction after yesterday\'s dramatic midday reversal. Most overseas markets moved higher, but it\'s unclear if Wall Street can build on the positive energy that carried indices back from huge early losses Tuesday.\n\nFutures prices did come back pretty well from losses last night, but still pointed down for the Nasdaq (COMP) and S&P 500 (SPX) in the early going. The Dow Jones Industrial Average ($DJI)  seemed ready to jump out to gains.\n\n### Big Earnings Week Rolls On\n\n**Boeing Co.** (NYSE:BA) looked like the earnings standout Wednesday, posting earnings per share of $3.58 and revenue of $25.15 billion as the company\'s defense and services businesses shined. Results easily topped third-party consensus estimates of $3.47 and $23.94 billion, and BA also raised its guidance. Shares jumped more than 4 percent in pre-market trading, which could help boost the DJIA today. In fact, the DJIA rose more than 100 points in pre-market trading, likely in part due to strength in BA.\n\nThat contrasted with slight pre-market drops in the S&P 500 (SPX) and Nasdaq (COMP), which contributed to the perception of a slightly rudderless situation, at least early on. It wouldn\'t be all that surprising to see things wander around a bit after a day like yesterday, which might have left some investors feeling like their heads are spinning from the whipsaw action.\n\nEarnings news from **AT &T Inc.** (NYSE:T) and **United Parcel Service, Inc.** (NYSE:UPS), the other big hitters early Wednesday aside from BA, wasn\'t as impressive. UPS met analysts\' earnings but fell short on the revenue line, and shares fell nearly 3 percent. T beat estimates on revenue but missed on earnings and saw its shares take a 3 percent hit. T\'s miss wasn\'t that big, but the stock got punished.\n\nLast night, **Texas Instruments Incorporated**(NASDAQ:TXN) had a revenue miss, and the stock plunged 6 percent in pre-market trading This one could be worth keeping an eye on considering the info tech sector remains in the spotlight. In financials, **Capital One Financial Corp.**(NYSE:COF) beat Wall Street\'s expectations but saw revenue fall year over year.\n\nThe weaker than expected revenue at UPS is probably going to be talked about today, because sometimes results from the big shipping companies can be seen as barometers for the economy. However, the miss was only a few million dollars out of more than a $17.4 billion quarter, and  U.S. revenue growth topped 8 percent, so investors might want to keep that in perspective. Generally, things looked strong on the revenue side, and UPS was able to get better pricing, which seems like a positive development.\n\nAside from earnings, investors might want to look out for September new home sales data this morning. Housing continues to be a struggling sector despite the booming economy. In addition, home price growth slowed to a more than six-year low in the UK, according to media reports. That could be another sign of economic struggles in the country as it wrestles with Brexit negotiations, and weakness overseas sometimes has a way of spreading to the U.S.\n\n### More Results on Tap After the Bell\n\nWith the morning\'s earnings batch out of the way, investors might focus on a new crop due this afternoon. Not the least of which is Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT). For the quarter, MSFT is expected to report adjusted EPS of $0.96, up from $0.84 in the prior-year quarter, on revenue of $27.9 billion, according to third-party consensus analyst estimates. Revenue is projected to increase 13.7 percent year over year. MSFT has a long streak of beating analysts\' expectations, with revenue beating estimates in 19 of the last 20 quarters. \n\nWhile several of MSFT\'s divisions have reportedly been growing at a double-digit pace, the company\'s cloud services divisions have been the major driver of revenue growth. When it last reported, revenue in the intelligent cloud division grew 23 percent year over year to $9.6 billion. Azure, the company\'s cloud computing platform, grew 89 percent year over year, the fastest out of all of its products and services.\n\n**Ford Motor Company** (NYSE:F) is another bellwether due to report after the close, For Q3, F is expected to report adjusted EPS of $0.28, down from $0.43 in the prior-year quarter, on revenue of $33.3 billion, according to third-party consensus analyst estimates. Revenue is projected to decline 1 percent year over year. \n\nThe company has been in the midst of a turnaround strategy, which has included eliminating pretty much its entire lineup of sedans to focus on pickups, SUVs and crossover-style vehicles. In July, CEO Jim Hackett announced that F would embark on an $11 billion restructuring, but so far some analysts have expressed frustration that there hasn\'t been much detail. After F canceled an investor meeting originally planned for September, that pretty much leaves today\'s earnings as the only opportunity for analysts to dig into the company\'s operations.\n\nOther major companies reporting this afternoon include **Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.** (NASDAQ:AMD), **Tesla Inc.**(NASDAQ:TSLA), and**Visa Inc.**(NYSE:V). Tomorrow morning brings **Twitter Inc.** (NYSE:TWTR), **American Airlines Group Inc.** (NYSE:AAL), and **Union Pacific Corporation**(NYSE:UNP), while tomorrow afternoon features **Amazon.com, Inc.** (NASDAQ:AMZN) and **Snap Inc.** (NYSE:SNAP). \n\n### Watching Those Potential Support Levels\n\nYesterday\'s early plunge and late surge might be a hard one for the market to top, at least for those who find entertainment value in those kind of sharp moves. The level to consider watching today, and possibly for the near future, is at around 2710 in the S&P 500 (SPX). That\'s the early October low that got briefly taken out intraday yesterday but which the market ended up closing above. A close below that might suggest more weakness, but there did seem to be considerable buying interest down there yesterday, so we\'ll see if that continues to hold.\n\nDespite the dramatic back and forth yesterday, volatility didn\'t come close to testing recent highs of around 28 for the VIX. That could be a sign that at least some investors don\'t expect too much additional downside pressure on the markets, at least not in the near term. The CBOE VIX--the most widely followed "fear index"--climbed 5 percent by the end of the day Tuesday, but at around 20 didn\'t seem to be really spreading much fear a week out from Halloween. VIX remained just above 20 early Wednesday.\n\nVolatility remains elevated from late summer when the VIX fell under 12. Anyone who thinks volatility won\'t be a factor moving forward could be fooling themselves. Though past isn\'t necessary prologue, history shows that these more volatile periods can take a while for the market to work out of, especially at times like these with an election ahead. For long-term investors, high volatility markets can send out a signal to consider taking extra caution going in and out of positions. This isn\'t necessarily a time when anyone should be thinking about going "all in" or "all out." Instead, consider bite-sized moves if the extra trading fees aren\'t a burden.\n\nFrom a sector perspective, some of the most beaten down stocks found some buyers late yesterday. These include homebuilders, a few of the banks, and even **IBM**(NYSE:IBM). However, it was Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) that really appeared to help lead the comeback, with what seemed to be conviction behind the buying. \n\n## Sector Struggles\n\nLooking from a 50,000 foot view, materials are the worst performing sector over the last month, down about 13 percent. Financials have fallen around 9 percent, and industrials around 8 percent. Utilities are the only positive sector over that stretch, followed by staples. But neither Treasury notes nor gold--two traditional areas investors have often bought during down periods--have really had much buying interest despite the stock market\'s struggles.\n\nSpeaking of struggles, crude oil could be the poster child this week (see Fig. 1 below). U.S. crude futures dipped below $66 a barrel at one point Tuesday, down around $10 from recent highs. Saudi Arabia\'s jawboning appeared to weigh on oil as the country promised it would keep the market supplied even when new U.S. sanctions against Iran take effect early next month. Earlier fears that the controversy surrounding the death of a Saudi journalist might push oil prices higher seem to be replaced by concerns that lower demand from slumping economies in China and Europe might keep prices weighed down. \n\nEnergy sector shares are off nearly 6 percent over the last month, and transport shares have taken a big plunge. However, lower energy costs, if they stick around, could potentially give airline and railway companies a boost.\n\n  \n**Figure 1: Crude Retreat:** This year-to-date chart shows that the most actively traded December crude oil futures contract dipped yesterday below its 200-day moving average (blue line) for the first time all year. Often, though not always, a drop below a long-term moving average can be a sign of more weakness to come. Data Source: CME Group.

Home sales in Illinois fell more than 10 percent in September from a year earlier. The numbers were even worse just looking at the nine-county Chicago metro area, where the great majority of Illinois residents live. Sales there fell 12 percent. Even as sales fell by more than 1,000 homes statewide, prices rose more than 3 percent."Consumers this fall are confronted with fewer options when they are looking for a new home," said Ed Neaves, Illinois REALTORSÂ® president-elect, in a press release. "Low inventories, coupled with increases in interest rates, are making it much tougher for some buyers to make a move, even though the data suggests many very much do want to make a purchase." This observation is only for Illinois, but judging from a preponderance of recent national data, it might hold true for many other states as well, a possible weight on homebuilder, home renovation, and home appliance stocks.\n\n### **Rate Hikes Still Seen Despite Weak Stocks**\n\nAtlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic yesterday seemed to reconfirm the Fed\'s relatively hawkish recent stance, following Fed Chair Jerome Powell\'s recent remarks that rates are a long way from neutral. Perhaps with that in mind, investors appear to be dialing in firm chances of a fourth rate hike this year. Odds of a December hike are above 80 percent, according to CME Fed funds futures, and odds are roughly 50 percent for an additional rate increase next March. However, there doesn\'t seem to be as much of a chance for a third rate hike by the middle of 2019, with futures showing less than a one-third chance. It\'s tough to predict that far out, but perhaps some of the geopolitical concerns and recent shakier corporate outlooks could be playing into that number for now.\n\n_Information from TDA is not intended to be investment advice or construed as a recommendation or endorsement of any particular investment or investment strategy, and is for illustrative purposes only.

As to be expected, analysts have expressed some concerns about Amazon (AMZN) and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)  increased focus on advertising. GOOGLhas been appealing the EU\'s $5 billion fine. And it disclosed a security bug in its Google+ social network that allowed unauthorized access to user data--it decided to shut down Google+ shortly after news of the breach became public. \n\nIn October, the company announced that it would be unbundling its Android operating system from the Google apps and create a mix of free software and paid licenses, a move that is supposed to help address the EU\'s concerns. \n\nRegarding the EU fine, GOOGL booked the charge the last time it reported, so its impact won\'t be reflected in this quarter. \n\nFor Q3, GOOGL is expected to report adjusted EPS of $10.42 on revenue of $34.04 billion, according to third-party consensus analyst estimates. In the same quarter last year, adjusted EPS came in at $9.57 on revenue of $27.77 billion. \n\n### Google TAC\n\nTraffic acquisition costs, or TAC, are what Google pays to partner websites to show ads on their properties. This is a sizable expense for the company that totaled $6.42 billion in Q2 2018, 23 percent of Google\'s total advertising revenues.\n\nMany analysts have expressed concerns in recent quarters that this number has trended higher over time and grown to eat up more advertising revenue. Shifts towards mobile and programmatic advertising have been the main culprits that management has blamed for higher TAC in the past, although in the last report they did say there were some improvements in programmatic that helped lower TAC rates there.    \n\nIn Q3, consensus analyst estimates call for $6.76 billion in TAC. \n\n### Other Revenues and Other Bets\n\nGOOGL\'s other revenues encompasses everything from Cloud, Play, Hardware to Wing and Loon, which were part of other bets up until recently. In Q2 2018, other revenues increased 37 percent year over year to $4.7 billion, and it has continued to become a more important part of the business. Consensus analyst estimates call for $4.8 billion in revenue from GOOGL\'s other revenues.\n\nOther bets is GOOGL\'s division that, like it sounds, are bets the company is making that are losing money now, but they hope will become larger businesses down the road. In Q2 2018, this division generated $145 million in revenue and an operating loss of $732 million. Analysts have indicated that they are expecting pretty similar results from this quarter. \n\n### Waymo\n\nWaymo, GOOGL\'s self-driving car division, has been one of the "Other Bets" divisions that many investors and analysts have been focused on. On last quarter\'s call, it was a main topic of discussion.  \n\nBy the end of 2018, GOOGL has said that it plans to launch a commercial car service in Phoenix, which CFO Ruth Porat called a first step to build out broader program in the future. Management also indicated it will continue to focus on developing relationships with vehicle manufacturers. Some of the automakers the company has announced it is working with include Fiat Chrysler (FCAU) and Jaguar. \n\n  \n**Up and Down.** Yesterday\'s drop put GOOGL back in the red for 2018. The stock was down 1.5 percent year to date at yesterday\'s close, but shares jumped higher at the open today and are up slightly on the year.  The stock is still down quite a ways from the all-time high of $1291.44 it hit back in July. Chart source: thinkorswimÂ® by TD Ameritrade. _Not a recommendation. For illustrative purposes only. Past performance does not guarantee future results._\n\n### Alphabet Options Trading Activity\n\nThis morning, GOOGL was rebounding after yesterday\'s broad sell-off that hit tech hard. However, with some of the action over the past few days, a lot could change by the time U.S. markets close.  \n\nAround the earnings release, options traders have priced in about a 5 percent stock move in either direction, according to the Market Maker Move indicator on the thinkorswimÂ® platform. As of this morning, implied volatility was at the 100th percentile. \n\nLooking at the Class A Shares (GOOGL), there has been a mix of options activity all over the place at the Oct. 26 weekly expiration. On the call side, there has been higher volume at the 1100 strike price, while there has just been a smattering of activity mostly right around the money. \n\nAt the Nov. 16 monthly expiration, a bulk of the activity on both the call and the put side has been at the 1100 strike. Other than that, there\'s been smaller volumes spread out across a range of strikes, mostly right around the money. \n\n_Note: Call options represent the right, but not the obligation, to buy the underlying security at a predetermined price over a set period of time.

The company\'s Q3 earnings won\'t be made public until November 11, but by all indications the results are going to be strong.\n\n"For the U.S. consumer, they\'re at work, they\'re seeing their wages rise, their confidence is strong. They\'ve been very very active in the marketplace. Obviously our numbers have been very strong. I think this is going to be a really strong holiday season, and our focus is on keeping our market share and to like the consumer during the holiday season," Cornell told CNBC in an exclusive TV interview.\n\nIt\'s the same tune Cornell\'s been singing since August, and he says they aren\'t seeing anything in the U.S. to indicate a change otherwise. Consumers are spending money and they\'re purchasing across all categories. They\'re focused online, and Target aims to help facilitate the process by getting aggressive with the elephant in the room, **Amazon.com, Inc.  **(NYSE:AMZN)--as well as the recent competitive surge from **Walmart Inc** (NYSE:WMT).\n\nThe retailer said Tuesday that starting Nov. 1 and running through Dec. 22, "hundreds of thousands of items" will be eligible for free, two-day shipping on Target.com. In March, it began offering the perk to its credit card holders or for those orders over $35. \n\nAlso this holiday season, Target said its "Drive Up" service -- where shoppers can place their orders online and have them brought directly to their cars -- will be at nearly 1,000 stores, ahead of a planned rollout schedule. And its same-day delivery option via Shipt will be available nationwide.\n\n"We want to make the busy holiday season easier for our guests so they can spend more time with their family and friends," said Target CEO Brian Cornell in a statement. "From same-day delivery with Shipt, Drive Up, Free 2-Day Shipping and more, no other retailer can match the convenient delivery options that Target will offer this season. When you combine these services with our incredible assortment of exclusive brands, everyday low prices and skilled team, I\'m confident Target will be America\'s easiest and most enjoyable place to shop for the holidays and beyond." \n\nNow, millions of guests in hundreds of markets across 46 states can have their groceries, gifts for family and friends, decorations and more, delivered to their doorstep in as little as one hour with Shipt. Guests place an order through the Shipt app or Shipt.com and choose from more than 55,000 Target products. Then, Shipt shoppers head to a local Target store to complete the order and deliver it to the guest\'s door.\n\nIn addition to offering convenient at-home delivery nationwide with Shipt, the retailer announced the expansion of its top-rated Drive Up service to nearly 1,000 stores by the end of October, ahead of schedule. With busy holiday schedules, Drive Up offers a convenient shopping solution for guests on the go. Guests place an order in the Target app and have their purchases brought to their car by a team member. Orders are ready within an hour, and are delivered to guests\' cars within two minutes of their arrival in the parking lot. Target makes more than 250,000 items available, including holiday decor, the season\'s hottest gifts, household must-haves for out-of-town visitors, and more.\n\nIn March 2018, Target announced the availability of Free 2-Day Shipping on hundreds of thousands of items for guests who spend $35 or use a REDcard. This holiday season, for the first time, the retailer will offer Free 2-Day Shipping to all guests on hundreds of thousands of items, beginning Nov. 1, with no minimum purchase or membership required. During peak periods, if Free 2-Day Shipping is not available, Target will offer guests free standard shipping. The retailer will offer guests free shipping through Dec. 22.\n\nWith the expansion of Shipt and Drive Up, Target offers the broadest range of fulfillment options in retail. In addition to Free 2-Day Shipping, options include:\n\n*       Order Pickup--Buy online and pick orders up in store on the same day for free. More than 250,000 items are eligible for this service available at all Target stores, and more than 95 percent of orders are ready within one hour.\n\n*       Target Restock--With Target Restock, guests place orders for basics like diapers, paper towels and pantry staples by 7 p.m. Monday through Friday and have them delivered the next day for a fee of $2.99 or free for REDcard holders.\n\n*       Delivery From Store--Guests can shop in store at select urban locations and have their purchases delivered to their homes that day for a flat fee of $7. This service is available in five markets: Boston, Chicago, New York, San Francisco and Washington, D.C.\n\nHear the latest episode\n\nTarget is also making it easier than ever for guests to grab the perfect gift for everyone on their list with a curated assortment of more than 1,400 new and exclusive gifts, most under $15. Designed to evoke a festive holiday market, up to 30 displays throughout each Target store will draw guests in with colorful canopies and clear signing to help them make the most of their time and budget, such as "Under $5, $10 or $15." The collections of gifts and stocking stuffers will feature options from across Target\'s multi-category assortment, satisfying even the toughest person on guests\' lists.\n\nIn addition, Target will have the top toys of the season in newly expanded departments across the country. With deeper inventory and a bigger assortment featuring more than 2,500 new and exclusive toys--nearly double last year--Target\'s toy department will be home to the most sought-after national and specialty brands, all at everyday low prices. Guests will find nearly a quarter-million square feet of additional space for toys across more than 500 stores and a completely reimagined experience in more than 100 remodeled stores.\n\nIt\'s a brave new world we\'re living regarding online shopping, e-commerce, and the power of the last mile delivery. Target\'s bold moves demonstrate a commitment in a category that only seems to be trending up.\n\nWant more content like this?

That doesn\'t mean the same thing will happen this time, but it\'s hard to blame investors if they feel skeptical about the stamina of this morning\'s green numbers. Early morning rallies after a big sell-off are pretty common, but they don\'t always last, and the rout isn\'t necessarily over. Anyone trying to participate today should consider taking special care, especially in the first half hour.\n\n### Twitter, Merck, Tesla--Strong Numbers Provide Pep\n\nOne element that potentially could give today\'s fledgling rally a little more battery power is another batch of healthy earnings data. **Tesla Inc.** (NASDAQ:TSLA), **Twitter Inc.** (NYSE:TWTR), and **Merck & Co., Inc.** (NYSE:MRK) are the latest high-profile companies to beat Wall Street analysts\' estimates. **Microsoft Corporation** (NASDAQ:MSFT) also reported a positive quarter Wednesday afternoon and saw shares climb 3 percent in pre-market trading.\n\nTSLA, in particular, seemed to genuinely surprise analysts by generating a profit, and shares popped more than 10 percent early Thursday. Stronger margins on the Model 3 appeared to help profitability, along with spending cuts. Some analysts said the company appeared to achieve better pricing on the Model 3, the company\'s lower-priced electric car model. One earnings report doesn\'t mean TSLA\'s recent troubles are over, but it does provide a different twist.\n\nTWTR shares also got a big lift early Thursday, jumping more than 14 percent after the company beat expectations and said it was taking measures to wipe the site clean of spam accounts. Merck inched higher, too, on what looked like a strong quarter. Remember that MRK is a component of the Dow Jones Industrial Average ($DJI), so its positive results could conceivably lend the DJIA a hand, as **Boeing Co.** (NYSE:BA) did early yesterday.\n\nThe earnings news wasn\'t all sunny. **Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.**(NASDAQ:AMD) shares plunged 18 percent in pre-market trading after the chip company missed analysts\' estimates for revenue and provided guidance that seemed to displease Wall Street.\n\nAside from earnings, there were other positive signs percolating early Thursday, including a slight uptick in Treasury yields and crude oil futures again flirting with $67.50 a barrel after falling below $66 earlier this week partly due to demand concerns.\n\nTwo Fed speakers are scheduled later today, including Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester, so that could be something to monitor. Most of the recent Fed speeches have taken a pretty hawkish tone.\n\n### Charts Torn Up As Panic Seems To Surface Late Wednesday\n\nLate Wednesday, for the first time in the current sell-off, a note of panic selling appeared to hit the market, and that might have been the final ingredient taking stocks down below what had been key technical support areas. The S&P 500 (SPX) has done a lot of damage to the technical charts lately, leaving little in the way of support points below it. One possible support level could be 2647, which represents a 10 percent drop from the all-time high and would officially send the SPX into correction territory. However, that\'s not really very far down from where the SPX closed yesterday.\n\nLast February, the most recent time the SPX posted a correction, the 10 percent decline was about the limit of it. That doesn\'t mean the same will necessarily be true this time around. However, with the economy outside of housing continuing to look strong, and earnings mostly good so far, there could be an argument for things to not get much worse. Still, these elements aren\'t predictable, and when markets fall this fast and dive below technical support they often trigger electronic selling that investors have set up to limit losses. This can exacerbate a market decline, and might have played a role in the late tumble yesterday. \n\n## Amazon, Alphabet in the Wings\n\nMore earnings are on tap after the close as the two "Big A\'s"--**Amazon.com, Inc.** (NASDAQ:AMZN) and **Alphabet Inc.** (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL)--report.  AMZN is expected to report adjusted EPS of $3.12, up from $0.52 in the prior-year quarter, on revenue of $57.1 billion, according to third-party consensus analyst estimates. Revenue is projected to increase 30.5 percent year over year. \n\nWhile there\'s always a lot going on at the company, analysts and investors appear to have honed in on three areas lately: ecommerce, cloud services and advertising, which the company has been rolling out in recent quarters. Amazon Web Services, or AWS, the company\'s cloud division, has been the company\'s most profitable from a margin perspective. AWS revenue in Q2 increased 49 percent year over year to $6.1 billion, and generated $1.64 billion in operating income, more than half of the total $2.98 billion. \n\nInvestors will likely parse the cloud data particularly closely after both **IBM** (NYSE:IBM) and Microsoft (MSFT) had hiccups in their cloud business last quarter. MSFT said yesterday that its Azure cloud platform had slower growth, though a 76 percent gain (down from 89 percent the prior quarter) still seems hard to call a slowdown. \n\nAMZN isn\'t grouped as a tech sector company, but the cloud computing aspect does fall under the tech space. All of last year and for much of 2018, info tech had been the sector helping prop the market, but during Wednesday\'s late sell-off, it became the sector that helped push things lower. \n\nOne thing seems pretty clear: At this point, earnings season remains the most important element in the picture, but many companies are having trouble coming up with numbers that seem to satisfy investors. Instead, a lot of the time even companies that beat analysts\' estimates have faced pressure in the market the last few weeks as many analysts and investors seem to be looking for something wrong instead of focusing on what\'s right. Companies that fail to meet expectations often get hammered. \n\nThis still looks like it could be an excellent earnings season, with research firm CFRA expecting a 21.6 percent year-over-year increase in earnings for S&P 500 companies and revenues up 8.3 percent. Next year, however, the firm sees earnings growth of just 9.9 percent. That would have looked pretty good a few years ago, but after all these quarters of huge gains, some investors might be looking ahead and wondering if the market can sustain the upward pace seen a few months ago.\n\nOctober continues to live up to its reputation for volatility. It\'s the most volatile month of the year, on average, going back to 1950. This year it comes before an important U.S. mid-term election and as Brexit negotiations hit a standstill and the trade war with China shows no sign of ending. Even if we were in July, the market might be volatile with all that on its plate. The Cboe\'s VIX--the most closely watched fear index--jumped to 25 late Wednesday, up from lows below 12 in September. It eased back to below 24 early Thursday. \n\n### GDP Data Ahead, Generating Some Stress\n\nAmid all the earnings, some big data loom early Friday when the government posts its first estimate for Q3 gross domestic product (GDP). Analysts expect a 3.3 percent gain, according to Briefing.com, which would be well under the 4.2 percent growth seen in Q2. \n\nArguably, the GDP number could spook the market by coming in either higher or lower than Wall Street expects. A number below 3 percent might have some investors and analysts concerned about a possible slowdown in U.S. growth, but a number of 4 percent or more could spark fears of an even more hawkish Fed jumping in to dial up rates in an attempt to arrest any overheating. \n\nIt might seem counterintuitive, but a GDP number that\'s "too good" might pummel the market further. We\'ve arguably reached a point in which the mindset has changed. A year ago, all data seemed to get a positive spin. Today, data news is often viewed as cautionary no matter how it comes out.\n\n**Figure 1:  Contagion Spreads: ** It\'s not just the three biggest indices getting hammered lately. Both the Russell 2000 (RUT) small-cap index and the Dow Jones Transportation Average (purple line) are also dramatically off their summer highs, when both posted all-time peaks.

Past performance does not guarantee future results._\n\n### **Safety Net**\n\nThroughout the various hills and valleys that form this year\'s turbulent stock market, one thing has held true, at least so far: For the most part, the bottom has been well defined. After February\'s 10% correction, levels seen at the low points held, for the most part, with only a few tests of the weakest levels after the big slump. To date this month, that had been true until Wednesday, with stocks turning around sharply Tuesday after an early 500-point plunge in the Dow Jones Industrial Average ($DJI). Many times so far this year, investors who\'ve "bought the dip" got rewarded for it. The bearish view is that one of these times, that just might not happen. The question is whether the current lows below 2660 in the S&P 500 (SPX) can hold and perhaps help the market carve out a bottom to its current dip. The dive below technical support points in the final half hour of yesterday\'s session arguably makes a quick comeback tougher, at least from a chart standpoint.\n\n### **Back to the Green(back)**\n\nThough the big drop in the major stock indices grabbed the headlines, yesterday\'s move higher in the U.S. Dollar Index ($DXY) might be a telling sign of the global macroeconomic mood. The rally to the mid-96 handle, within a stone\'s throw of the 2018 high, came on a day in which the 10-year Treasury yield softened 6 basis points--suggesting a flight to safety, rather than an interest rate play--was behind the move. Among places seeing their currencies soften versus the greenback are the British pound--where Brexit woes continue, the euro--which has been sliding on stability concerns in Italy, and currencies along the Pacific Rim--in which there\'s concern a flagging economy in China may have a ripple effect across the region. For U.S.-based multinationals already battling trade tensions and labor cost pressures--**Caterpillar Inc.** (NYSE:CAT), **3M Co** (NYSE:MMM) and **Harley-Davidson Inc.** (NYSE:HOG) are among the firms pointing to such challenges during recent earnings calls--a flight to the dollar could fan the flames.        \n\n### **Stuck in Mud**\n\nThink you\'ve had some tough weeks in the stock market lately? Imagine the plight of the pig farmer. Though many agricultural commodities have come under pressure this year due in part to the tariff battle with China, hog futures are among the ones deepest in the mud, so to speak. Prices for the front-month futures contract recently sank to one-year lows, and are down to around $57 per hundredweight, from $81 earlier this year and a five-year high of $133 posted back in 2014. A recent Wall Street Journal article noted that China--the world\'s biggest pork consumer--is finding places other than the U.S. to buy the meat from, including Spain, Canada, and South America amid tariffs against U.S. pork. All this could mean higher U.S. pork supplies and maybe lower meat prices. In Arizona, for instance bacon prices are down 88 cents a pound from a year ago, according to the Arizona Daily Star. That\'s good news for consumers, and also for grocery and fast food companies that can buy meat for less. It\'s not such good news for big agricultural processing firms like **Tyson Foods, Inc.**(NYSE:TSN) and **Hormel Foods Corp.** (NYSE:HRL), though HRL shares are doing well this year.\n\n_Information from TDA is not intended to be investment advice or construed as a recommendation or endorsement of any particular investment or investment strategy, and is for illustrative purposes only.

The survey found that Chick-Fil-A is the No. 1 restaurant among teens.\n\nBrands continue to be important in the attraction of teen buyers, with 45 percent of respondents saying the brand is the most important factor in a purchase, up from 33 percent six years ago.

 'Market turmoil continued Monday.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 245 points in Monday\'s session, and at one point was down nearly 560 points before coming back at the close. The sell-off brings the total decline in the index to about 9 percent from its Oct. 3 highs. A correction is generally defined as a 10 percent or greater decline in the price from its most recent peak.\n\n### More Trade Fears\n\nBloomberg reported the U.S. is preparing to announce tariffs on all remaining Chinese imports if talks next month between presidents Donald Trump and Xi Jinping fail to ease the ongoing trade war.\n\n  * The Dow closed down 245 points (1 percent) at 24,443.26.\n  * The S&P 500 closed down 26 points (1 percent) at 2,632.67.\n  * The Nasdaq Composite closed down 116 points (1.6 percent) at 7,050.29.\n\n\n\n"Major indexes are on course to end October with their biggest one-month loss in years, hurt by growing worries about the health of the global economy, as well as broader concerns about tightening monetary policy," Wall Street Journal\'s Riva Gold and Akane Otani reported.\n\n"I think in order to actually renew leadership and faith in the market, you\'ve got to see more strength in growth stocks," said Patrick Spencer, vice chairman of equities at Baird. "Bear markets are almost always associated with recession, and I just don\'t see it on the horizon."\n\n### Tech Wrecked\n\nTech stocks took a brutal hit Monday.\n\n"The market will not reward earnings unless you\'ve got growth in the top line, bottom line and guidance. It can be brutal for companies that don\'t hit all those marks," CNBC quoted Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial, as saying. "There are questions remaining on whether this market can really regain strength if tech doesn\'t lead."\n\nHere\'s a look at some of notable tech wrecks Monday:\n\n  * **Amazon.com, Inc.** (NASDAQ:AMZN) closed down 6.3 percent to $1,538.88. The stock has been under pressure all month, accelerated by last week\'s mixed earnings report.\n  * **Apple Inc** (NASDAQ:AAPL) down 1.8 percent at $212.24. Apple is expected to release Q4 earnings Thursday afternoon.\n  * **Facebook Inc** (NASDAQ:FB) down 2.2 percent at $142.09. Facebook reports Q3 earnings Tuesday afternoon.\n  * **Netflix, Inc.** (NASDAQ:NFLX) down 5 percent at $284.84.\n\n\n\n**Boeing Co** (NYSE:BA) almost took a major hit, falling 6.6 percent to $335.59\n\n_Related Links:_\n\n_How To Trade During A Stock Market Correction_\n\n_One Market Watcher \'s Custom Index -- And Why It Matters_\n\nAfter flirting with correction territory late last week, stocks look poised to post some early gains Monday. The question is whether any morning strength can last through the day, with the market still on pace for its worst month in almost a decade.\n\nIt\'s hard to capture sentiment in a nutshell, but one way to think of the current situation is to see it as a readjustment. Many investors seem to be looking at company outlooks amid the current geopolitical mood and deciding that previous valuations may no longer be appropriate\n\nToday isn\'t scheduled to bring much in the way of milestone company reports, but this week is set to be one of the busiest of the earnings season (see more below). So far, 77 percent of S&P 500 companies have beaten Wall Street analysts earnings per share estimates, compared with the five-year average of 71 percent, according to FactSet. Also, 59 percent of companies have beaten on sales, in line with the five-year average. \n\nOn the corporate front, **IBM** (NYSE:IBM) announced the $34 billion purchase of **Red Hat Inc.**(NYSE:RHT) in a deal designed to enhance IBM\'s cloud division. Recall that earlier this month, IBM reported slowing cloud sales in an earnings report that many analysts saw as disappointing. Shares of IBM slumped to nine-year lows following the Red Hat announcement. \n\nAll major indices finished last week with sharp losses. This week brings the end of this stomach-churning month, along with another full batch of earnings and data--including a jobs report and results from **Apple Inc.** (NASDAQ:AAPL). Overnight saw another plunge in China\'s stock market, but some positive traction in Europe. The closely watched 10-year U.S. Treasury yield clicked up slightly to 3.09 percent, but remains well under the month\'s highs above 3.25 percent.\n\nOne thing to consider keeping an eye on this week is the FAANGs. As we saw last week, action in these five stocks tends to boomerang around the market. When **Amazon.com, Inc.** (NASDAQ:AMZN) and **Alphabet Inc.** (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) retreated last week, it helped drag the market with them. AAPL\'s earnings later this week, scheduled for after the close Thursday, could loom large.\n\n### Earnings Keep Rolling In\n\nApple is arguably just the tip of the iceberg in a week that, when finished, will see the majority of earnings season completed. Other key company reports include **Facebook Inc.** (NASDAQ:FB), **The Coca-Cola Co.** (NYSE:KO), **General Motors Company** (NYSE:GM), **Alibaba Group Holding, Ltd.** (NYSE:BABA), **Chevron Corporation** (NYSE:CVX) and **ExxonMobil Corporation** (NYSE:XOM). \n\nIt might be a good idea to keep listening to company conference calls, because so far they\'ve likely been behind some of the negative sentiment these last few weeks. Companies across many industries have been expressing concerns about a stronger U.S. dollar, higher energy costs, and tariffs all taking a toll on current or future performance. **United Parcel Service, Inc.** (NYSE:UPS), **Anheuser-Busch Inbev NV** (NYSE:BUD), and **Illinois Tool Works Inc.** (NYSE:ITW) were among the companies last week mentioning foreign currency struggles.\n\nThat\'s kind of what many analysts had feared going into earnings, and points up how even strong quarterly performance often isn\'t enough to give stocks a boost if investors are fretting about the future. The dollar index rose intraday Friday above 96.80, near its yearly high, before retreating slightly. Many companies say foreign exchange has been and could continue to be a challenge. GM, KO and AAPL all could be interesting to hear on that aspect of things when they report, considering their large international businesses. CEO calls are more important than ever.\n\n### Some Investors Seem To Be Readjusting Expectations\n\nSo what we might be seeing here is a simple readjusting of expectations among many investors as these troubles start to hit earnings. It\'s arguable that the fundamentals behind many stocks, including AMZN and GOOG, haven\'t changed all that much. What does seem to be changing is the multiple some investors are willing to pay for those companies as they look down the road and perhaps see a little less opportunity for growth, especially considering all the outside fundamental issues mentioned above. Even companies with positive guidance see their stocks struggling, and those with negative guidance are getting hammered.\n\nExcept for the late sell-off Wednesday, the downturn has mostly been orderly. There\'s little panic selling. Instead, many investors seem to be selling a little and then sitting back to see what might happen next. This process could continue throughout earnings season. Also, every day has had a few green patches where certain sectors have shown a little strength. This could be seen as healthy.\n\nStill, volatility remains elevated and there\'s little reason to expect that to change in the coming days. With that in mind, investors might want to consider trading small as long as they don\'t mind increased trading costs. That means if someone normally trades 1,000 shares, they might want to consider trading 300 or 400 instead, at least while volatility continues to surge. Things are moving fast, and you don\'t want to jump in front of a freight train. Also, people who trade using stops should consider widening those as long as volatility remains high. VIX, the market\'s most closely watched "fear index," climbed above 26 Friday, well above the historic average of mid-teens.\n\n### Payrolls, Inflation Data Coming Into View\n\nThe new week promises a wealth of economic data, highlighted by Friday\'s U.S. payrolls report for October. Recall that in September, job growth of 134,000 was well below analysts\' estimates, but the unemployment rate fell to near 50-year lows and wages, while up, arguably stayed out of "overheated" territory. Investors awaiting the October data should keep in mind that any wage growth of more than the 2.8 percent year-over-year rate seen in September might fuel concerns about inflation and a possible hawkish Fed reaction.\n\nEven in light of the stock market selloff, futures prices indicate a nearly 65 percent chance of a rate hike before the end of the year. While that\'s down from above 80 percent a few weeks ago, odds still seem pretty high that a fourth rate hike is in store. However, chances for a follow-up rate hike in March took a tumble last week and currently sit below 40 percent, from above 50 percent just a week ago, according to CME futures. \n\nThe jobs report might give a sense of the inflation picture, but there\'s nothing like actual inflation data for that, and investors get some Monday with Personal Consumption Expenditure (PCE) prices. The Fed looks very closely at these, so investors should consider doing the same. The data Monday for September showed a 0.1 percent increase in PCE prices, in line with analysts\' expectations. Core prices rose 0.2 percent a little above the 0.1 percent that Wall Street had dialed in. Personal income in September rose 0.2 percent, below the 0.4 percent consensus estimate. \n\n  \n**FIGURE 1:  FLIGHTS TO SAFETY?** Though the U.S. Dollar Index (candle chart) sometimes sees strength during times of extreme market volatility (as shown by the Cboe Volatility Index--VIX--purple line), that\'s not always the case. The two have moved in tandem, however, over the last round of October volatility. Image sources: Cboe Global Markets, ICE. Chart source: The thinkorswimÂ® platform from TD Ameritrade. _For illustrative purposes only. Past performance does not guarantee future results._  \n\n### **Pulling Back the Curtain on Data**\n\nWhile headline data can provide a helpful snapshot, it often helps to dig under the main number to get a little more insight. Investors who did that with Friday\'s key data--GDP and Michigan sentiment--might have noticed there was more than meets the eye to both. For instance, even though the headline Q3 GDP growth of 3.5 percent beat analysts\' consensus of 3.3 percent, the report showed very slow growth of just 0.8 percent in company investment during the quarter, down from more than 11 percent in Q2. That could raise questions about whether companies see enough economic justification to re-invest in their businesses moving forward. Inventories grew, but could have reflected some companies loading up on goods ahead of time to beat looming tariffs on Chinese imports.  Also, consumer spending rose sharply, perhaps due in part to the tax cut. Another really big growth area was government spending, which can stimulate the economy but by its very nature typically isn\'t seen in the same light as consumer and company spending.\n\nThe Michigan sentiment headline number of 98.6 seemed healthy enough and didn\'t point to any feverish overheating among consumers. It was down slightly from the year\'s highs, but above its lows. However, consumers in the survey said they see inflation ticking up next year to nearly 3 percent, though they expect it to moderate in the long-term. "Importantly, stock price declines, rising inflation and interest rates, and the negative midterm election campaigns, have not acted to undermine consumer confidence," Richard Curtin, director of the University of Michigan consumer survey, said in a statement. "Needless to say, consumers are not immune to these factors."\n\n### **Balance Beam**\n\nOften during the last two years, long-term investors heard that they should check allocations to make sure the rally hadn\'t caused their portfolios to weight toward equities beyond their comfort levels. After all, if stocks get on the express elevator straight up, it\'s likely that a portfolio would swell from those gains, raising the percentage devoted to stocks without an investor doing anything.  Someone who wanted, say, 50 percent of a portfolio to be in stocks and 50 percent in fixed income, might suddenly find themselves at 60-40. The key is to take a look every quarter, or at mid-year, and calculate whether the percentages moved out of line. At that point, the investor could re-balance by weighting the portfolio back to the original comfort zone. This correction we\'re in now might turn the tables a bit. At this point, with around half of S&P 500 stocks down 20 percent or more from their peaks and the S&P 500 (SPX) and Nasdaq (COMP) officially in correction, those losses might mean some investors aren\'t weighted enough toward stocks. Long-term investors might want to take a look this weekend (if they can bear facing those losses), and make sure they\'re still comfortable with the proportion of their portfolios dedicated to equities. It\'s called rebalancing, and can be done when the market is going down or going up.\n\n### **Amazon Cruise**\n\nOne interesting note about AMZN that stands in contrast to all the bearish stock movement Friday: Its quarterly earnings keep rising, and have been going steadily up now for about three years. It\'s getting harder to remember the days when some investors dismissed AMZN as an all sales, no earnings story. Now many seem worried about the company\'s revenue, especially slowing growth in its online retail sales, even as earnings grow and grow. The price-to-earnings ratio remains very high, but it\'s no longer infinite, perhaps a sign that the company is evolving over time especially as it ventures into conceivably more profitable ventures like cloud computing and advertising.\n\n_Information from TDA is not intended to be investment advice or construed as a recommendation or endorsement of any particular investment or investment strategy, and is for illustrative purposes only.

IBM said it will make no changes to Red Hat\'s business and open source development model as it was an early support of Linux.\n\nHere\'s a summary of how some of the Street\'s top analysts reacted to the deal.\n\n### Goldman Sachs: The Details\n\nGoldman Sachs\' Heather Bellini said in a note IBM\'s offer of $190 per share in cash ($34 billion) for Red Hat implies:\n\n  * Eight times multiple on calendar 2019 billings and seven times on 2020 billings\n  * Nine times 2019 sales and eight times 2020 sales\n  * Thirty-one times 2019 free cash flow and 27 times 2020 free cash flow.\n\n\n\n### Wells Fargo: Narrow The Gap\n\nIBM\'s proposed acquisition signals its intention to "narrow the gap" in the cloud space versus formidable competitors including **Amazon.com, Inc.** (NASDAQ:AMZN)\'s AWS and **Microsoft Corporation** (NASDAQ:MSFT)\'s Azure, Wells Fargo\'s Ed Caso wrote in a note. The acquisition gives IBM better exposure to target large enterprises where a hybrid cloud solution is the preferred approach.\n\n### Wedbush: \'Competitive Statement\'\n\nIBM signaled to the market a "notable competitive statement" by offering to buy Red Hat with the objective of becoming the No. 1 hybrid cloud provider, Wedbush\'s Moshe Katri said in a note. IBM will be positioned to offer an open cloud solution to unlock the full value of the cloud for clients.\n\nKatri said the deal comes with several risks following Red Hat\'s recent misses and execution challenges.\n\n### Bank Of America: IBM Wants To Dominate\n\nRed Hat is the second largest provider of Server Operating Systems (OS) with a 33 percent market share and posted a 20 percent growth in its open-source Linux based OS in calendar year 2017, Bank of America\'s Wamsi Mohan said in a note. Red Hat also offers middleware, virtualization, containers and open-source cloud computing platforms which under IBM\'s umbrella gives the company the capability to become one of the dominant hybrid cloud providers.\n\n### Tigress: Turning Point\n\nIBM\'s proposed acquisition of Red Hat would represent the largest in its history and be seen as a turning point, Tigress Financial Partners\' Ivan Feinseth said in his daily newsletter. At the very least, the acquisition would make IBM "more interesting" in the near term and the stock could be a attractive once the integration is complete with clear signs of success.\n\n### Price Action\n\nShares of IBM were trading lower by more than 4 percent Monday, while Red Hat was trading higher by nearly 50 percent at $173.35.\n\n_Related Links:_\n\n_Wall Street Divided On Buying The IBM Dip_\n\n_Red Hat CEO Says Q2 Marks Enterprise Linux\'Bottom\'_\n\n_Photo courtesy of Red Hat._\n\n**IBM Common Stock** (NYSE:IBM) announced it will purchase **Red Hat Inc** (NYSE:RHT)\'s issued and outstanding common shares for $190 per share in cash.\n\nThe $34 billion deal -- the culmination of a 20-year partnership -- prompted a 51-percent pop in Red Hat, a 2.7-percent decline in IBM.\n\n### **Why It \'s Important**\n\nWith the transaction, IBM expects to become the leading hybrid cloud provider poised to dominate a $1 trillion growth market.

 '**Amazon.com, Inc.**(NASDAQ:AMZN) has been one of the hottest stocks in the market over the past several years, but the fun has been on pause for Amazon investors in the past month. Amazon\'s stock has tanked by 24 percent, but one analyst says the sell-off is an obvious buying opportunity.\n\n### The Analyst\n\nAegis analyst Victor Anthony reiterated his Buy rating for Amazon and raised his price target from $2,065 to $2,225.\n\n### The Thesis\n\nAnthony said fears over a second consecutive quarterly earnings miss, a fourth-quarter guidance miss, increasing e-commerce and cloud competition, slowing online sales growth and potential regulatory threats are overblown. Despite concerns online sales growth could drop to the single digits in 2019, Anthony said Amazon\'s long-term trajectory is just fine.\n\n"Amazon, in our view, remains one of the best longer-term values in Tech and we still see a path to where the shares could double over the next three years," he wrote.\n\nAmazon has given long-term investors plenty of opportunities throughout history to buy the stock on post-earnings weakness, and Anthony said it has been a wise decision every time. Amazon\'s margins are expanding, its revenue growth is impressive, and its free cash flow is improving. AWS has been a particularly strong performer, generating 46 percent revenue growth in the most recent quarter.\n\nAnthony said Amazon\'s advertising business could generate $12 billion in high-margin revenue next year, and its retail business is still gaining market share from brick-and-mortar sellers.\n\n### Price Action\n\nAmazon\'s stock traded lower by 1 percent Tuesday to $1,522.28.\n\n_Related Links:_\n\n_Why Did Somebody Aggressively Buy About Half A Million Shares Of Apple Thursday Night? _\n\n_The Latest Tech Wreck Sends Markets Lower; S&P 500, Nasdaq Close In Correction Territory_'
 'For some market participants the real treat on Oct. 31 won\'t be Halloween candy, but rather the end of the month.\n\nOver the history of U.S. equity markets, October has been a challenging month for stocks and October 2018 lived up to that reputation. As of Oct. 29, the S&P 500 sported a month-to-date decline of 9.4 percent, putting the benchmark U.S. equity index on pace for its sixth-worst October performance in history.\n\n### What Happened\n\nNot only has this year brought another October challenge for domestic stocks, October 2018 is poised to be one of the worst months for stocks in 45 years.\n\n"Also, month-to-date, the S&P 500 is having its 34th worst month on record and its worst month since Feb. 2009, when it lost 11.0%," said S&P Dow Jones Indices. "The top ten worst months in S&P 500 history in chronological order date back to Nov. 1973, nearly 45 years ago, when the S&P 500 lost 11.4%, the most in 26 years, since Nov. 1948, when it lost 10.8%."\n\nUnderscoring the weakness in U.S. stocks this month are significant declines across size segments, indicating mid- and small-cap names have not been immune to the selloff.\n\n### Why It\'s Important\n\nSector-level weakness was particularly acute this month with some sectors, including consumer discretionary and energy, notching some of their worst monthly performances on record. The **Energy Select Sector SPDR** (NYSE:XLE), the largest equity-based energy exchange traded fund, is lower by 13 percent this month.\n\n"Energy was the worst performing sector across the sizes, losing 13.8%, 19.1% and 21.7% in large-, mid-, and small-caps, respectively, as the S&P GSCI (WTI) Crude Oil lost 8.5% month-to-date (through Oct. 29, 2018)," according to S&P Dow Jones.\n\nWeakness in **Amazon.com Inc.** (NASDAQ:AMZN) is highlighting concentration risks in cap-weighted consumer discretionary ETFs like the **Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR**(NYSE:XLY). Amazon, by far the largest holding in a slew of large-cap, cap-weighted consumer cyclical ETFs, is down 23.65 percent this month. As a result, XLY is lower by 11 percent.\n\nLike the S&P 500 Energy Index, the S&P 500 Consumer Discretionary Index is on pace for its third-worst month on record.\n\n### What\'s Next\n\nPast performance is never a guarantee of future returns, but historical data confirm that when stocks experience significant October losses, November can be rough as well.\n\n"In the past, the S&P 500 lost in all the Nov. months following the most losing Oct.\'s. The Nov. returns of the S&P 500 in 1987, 1929, 2008, 1932, 1937 were -8.5%, -13.4%, -7.5%, -5.9% and -10.1%, respectively," said S&P Dow Jones.\n\n_Related Links:_\n\n_Bond ETFs For Higher Rates_\n\n__This ETF Is Really Cheap_ _\n\nFor investors, a month that\'s delivered more tricks than treats finally draws to a close today with the tone looking positive after firm earnings from **General Motors Company** (NYSE:GM). The end of the month, however, doesn\'t necessarily mean an end to the volatility that\'s held a vice grip over the last few weeks.\n\nYesterday might have seemed like a little light at the end of the tunnel for some investors as stocks staged a vigorous and broad-based rally that included every sector and put the S&P 500 (SPX) and the Dow Jones Industrial Average ($DJI) back into the black for the year. However, even if the positive energy continues--and that\'s far from guaranteed--there\'s little expectation of a decline in volatility anytime soon. \n\nIt\'s quite possible this sort of choppy action could continue in weeks to come, considering all the geopolitical events on the calendar. We\'re less than a week from U.S. midterm elections, and overseas developments seem to bring their own cast of ghosts and goblins to haunt the markets nearly every day. The latest came early Wednesday when manufacturing data out of China failed to meet analysts\' expectations. \n\n### General Motors Could Help Provide Lift With Firm Earnings\n\nThere didn\'t seem to be much haunting GM in Q3, though, as the auto company reported better than expected results Wednesday. Shares rose nearly 9 percent in pre-market trading. Earnings per share of $1.87 and revenue of $35.79 billion, compared with third-party consensus estimates of $1.25 and $34.85 billion.\n\nAverage transaction prices for GM rose to more than $36,000, which is $4,000 above the industry average, thanks in part to sales of the company\'s new and pricey full-size pickup trucks. Also, despite the trade war underway between the U.S. and China, GM seemed to perform well in that Asian country, citing "record Cadillac sales and strong Chevrolet deliveries" there, according to the company\'s earnings release. \n\nThough the Q3 ended before the market got shaky in October, GM\'s results do seem to reinforce impressions that U.S. consumers are mostly doing fine. When a car company highlights sales of a pickup truck where pricing begins at $54,700 (like the GMC Sierra Denali that debuted in August), that could be one sign that at least some consumers are opening their wallets for big items (literally "big" in this case). Also, the GM sales follow strong sales from some other retailers reporting recently, and a report yesterday from Johnson Redbook showing U.S. retail sales at comparable stores rose 5.9 percent for the week ended Oct. 27.\n\nBefore GM reported, **Facebook Inc.** (NASDAQ:FB) shared a bit of a mixed quarterly picture late Tuesday (see more below), but shares popped more than 5 percent in pre-market trading. Though FB\'s earnings per share of $1.76 was well ahead of analysts\' average $1.47 estimate, revenue of $13.73 billion fell short of the $13.78 billion estimate. Daily active users of 1.49 billion were up 9 percent year-over-year, but came in a touch below the average estimate, as well.\n\nThe FB earnings followed disappointing results from fellow FAANG stocks **Amazon.com, Inc.** (NASDAQ:AMZN) and **Alphabet Inc.** (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) last week. Tomorrow brings the finale for FAANGs with **Apple Inc.** (NASDAQ:AAPL) earnings after the close. \n\n### Consumers Don\'t Seem Affected As of Yet\n\nYesterday\'s consumer confidence data might have provided more evidence that whatever\'s going on in the stock market, it doesn\'t necessarily reflect the wider economy. The October reading from the Conference Board of 137.9 was the highest for any month since September 2000, back when Bill Clinton was president and the S&P 500 (SPX) was under 1,500.\n\nThe report came after a strong University of Michigan sentiment reading last week and firm 3.5 percent GDP growth in Q3. There hasn\'t been any data yet indicating the U.S. consumer isn\'t doing well. That might also explain why any company in retail that misses on revenue is likely to get punished once we hit the heart of retail earnings season in the weeks ahead. However, remember that there is such a thing as the "wealth effect," a theory that argues consumers tend to buy more when they feel like they\'re doing well in the stock market. That\'s why the November consumer confidence data could be worth monitoring.\n\nFrom a technical standpoint, the major indices made some progress on the charts yesterday, with the SPX climbing out of correction territory under 2650. It\'s still way under the 200-day moving average of 2765, which remains a possible resistance point. The Dow Jones Industrial Average ($DJI) remains down more than 7 percent from its all-time high close even after Tuesday\'s rally, while the Nasdaq (COMP) is still down 11 percent from its highs, which keeps it in correction mode for now, anyway.\n\nAsian and European markets mostly drifted higher overnight, and that might lend some strength to the U.S. market this morning as well.\n\n###  **FIGURE 1:   Soda Outpaces Phones This Month: **This one-month chart shows how information technology stocks (candlestick) are being easily outpaced by consumer staples (purple line). Data Source: S&P Dow Jones Indices. Chart Source: The thinkorswimÂ® platform from TD Ameritrade. For illustrative purposes only. Past performance does not guarantee future results.  \n**Squaring Up?**\n\nOne thing investors might want to ponder as this turbulent month winds down is the possibility of some "position squaring" today in the last session of October. This can sometimes happen at the end of the month as some traders offset short or long positions. At the end of a month like this, with major indices down so sharply, if traders decide to take profit on short positions, such position squaring could give the market a bit of a boost. Some of that might have played into Tuesday\'s revival, but that doesn\'t mean it\'s necessarily all over.\n\n### **Tug of War in Facebook Shares**\n\nThis month has had its ups and downs, to say the least. So did Facebook (FB) shares in the hours after the close yesterday following the company\'s earnings report. FB missed third-party consensus expectations on revenue and users, but beat earnings per share estimates. The stock rose immediately after the earnings report, then fell, then rose again. It almost seemed like a tug of war between bulls and bears. The bulls might argue that FB\'s misses on revenue and users were pretty light, and it beat EPS quite substantially. The bears could say, however, that it\'s relatively easy for a company to find a way to make earnings look good, but revenue is revenue. There\'s no way around it if revenue doesn\'t keep up. So far, the FAANGs haven\'t had a really smooth earnings season, with FB the latest to report imperfect results following Amazon (AMZN) and Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) last week. Next up: Apple (AAPL) tomorrow.\n\n### **Get Your Pencils and Scorecards Ready**\n\nFor anyone keeping score at home, the last day of the month starts with the S&P 500 (SPX) down 7.9 percent for October, the Dow Jones Industrial Average ($DJI) down 6 percent, and the Nasdaq Composite (COMP) down 11 percent. The SPX is on track for its worst month since May 2010, while you have to go back to October 2007 to find a worse month for the COMP. However, the DJIA had a worse month than this as recently as August 2015. \n\n_Information from TDA is not intended to be investment advice or construed as a recommendation or endorsement of any particular investment or investment strategy, and is for illustrative purposes only.
