=== Judge's Evaluation: AMZN - Market Data Until 2015-11-01 ===

Based on the provided market data and news, predict the LLM’s decision:
News Factors Considered:
['* **_Amazon.com, Inc._**_(NASDAQ:AMZN) is scheduled to announce its third quarter financial results on Thursday, after the market closes._\n  * _On Monday, Bank of America Merrill Lynch released a preview of the results._\n  * _The analysts expect a solid quarter, with potential upside for Amazon Web Services. Thus they reiterated a Buy rating and $620.00 price target._\n\n\n\nAmazon is reporting its third quarter results on Thursday, and Bank of America Merrill Lynch analysts Justin Post and Paul Bieber envision "stable to accelerating" revenue growth and stable unit growth on a mixed retail environment in the U.S.\n\nThe experts expect:\n\n  * Prime Day to benefit the results and outlook\n  * Amazon Prime to have driven market share gains for the EGM category\n  * Momentum in Amazon Web Services revenue\n  * An "easy 4Q media revenue comp."\n\n\n\nOn the risks side, they expound, the biggest may be a fourth quarter Street CSOI estimate of $1.8 billion, which could stand considerably above guidance, "depending on retail delivery, India and content investments." However, this number could be eventually achievable if fourth quarter retail remains robust and AWS ramps.\n\nMoreover, in the case of a disappointing CSOI outlook, the analysts "would expect buyers to emerge as the AWS/cloud story may be the best long-term theme in tech."\n\n###  **The Estimates**\n\nFor Amazon\'s third quarter, BAML expects to see:\n\n  * Revenue of $24.9 billion, in line with the Street\'s estimate\n  * CSOI of  $672 million, versus the Street\'s $619 million\n  * Earnings of $0.84 per share, compared to the Street\'s $0.87 per share.\n\n\n\nThe revenue estimate is based on 22 percent year-over-year unit growth - although sequentially flat. The experts believe a growth of 35 to 40 percent in gross profit "is needed to help maintain bullish thesis."\n\n"AWS growth, 3P mix, fulfillment center builds, video content spend, and India spending ramp are levers that can drive upside/downside to margins and EPS," they add.\n\n###  **So, Why Is The Stock Worth $620?**\n\nBAML remains constructive on Amazon on the back of three main factors:\n\n1) Prime traction will likely drive strong EGM revenue in North America\n\n2) "AWS product, customer and revenue momentum"\n\n3) Potential margin upside provided by AWS, the 3P mix and fulfillment efficiency.\n\n \n\n_Disclosure: Javier Hasse holds no positions in any of the securities mentioned above._\n\n  * The New York Times published a sharp critique of **Amazon.com, Inc.** (NASDAQ: AMZN) work culture.\n  * Allegations include a process of sending "secret feedback" to bosses in order to "sabotage" co-workers. \n  * Jay Carney, Amazon\'s Senior Vice President for Global Corporate Affairs responded to the "harsh" allegations, noting the piece lacked "journalistic standards" and misleading facts.\n\nAccording to The New York Times, Amazon\'s style of management is unique – and certainly not in a good way. The New York Times published a scathing report on August 15 detailing terrible working conditions at Amazon\'s head office. One such example includes human resources executives partaking in an annual "cullings of the staff," or "purposeful Darwinism." Meanwhile, employees lucky enough to keep their job following a cancer diagnosis, miscarriage, or other personal crisis were "evaluated unfairly" or "edged out rather than giving time to recover." The report went on cite Bo Olson, an Amazon employee of less than two years. During his tenure, he claimed that "nearly every person" he worked with would "cry at their desk." In a blog post published on Monday, Jay Carney, Amazon\'s Senior Vice President for Global Corporate Affairs and former reporter at TIME and White House Press Secretary, stated that Olson was in fact fired from the company for attempting to defraud vendors and cover up his activities it with falsified business records. "Why weren\'t readers given that information?," Carney questioned. He added that the New York Times failed to disclose the possibility that the ex-employee "might have an axe to grind." Carney continued that the New York Times article was full of one-sided, inaccurate, or flat out false statements. Another example includes a testimony by Chris Brucia who received a "punishing performance" from his boss, along with a half-hour "lecture" before being notified that he is actually being promoted. Carney responded to this particular allegation: "Had the Times asked about this, we would have shared what [the performance review] said. "Overall," the document reads, "you did an outstanding job this past performance year." Mr. Brucia was given exceptionally high ratings and then promoted to a senior position." Carney also suggested that had The New York times properly "checked their facts" and seeked out Amazon\'s side of the story, the article would have been "a lot less sensational, a lot more balanced, and, let\'s be honest, a lot more boring." "It might not have merited the front page, but it would have been closer to the truth," he further argued. Finally, Carney stated for the record that he participated in the article by sharing what was initially asked for, but was "not offered an opportunity to see, respond to, or help fact-check the "stack of negative anecdotes" that was ultimately used." Tim Seymour said on CNBC\'s Fast Money Final Trade that **Goldman Sachs Group Inc** (NYSE: GS) was oversold and he thinks that it is coming back. Josh Brown is a buyer of **Transocean LTD** (NYSE: RIG). He would place a stop loss under $12. Brian Kelly thinks that **Twitter Inc** (NYSE: TWTR) should be bought. Guy Adami believes that **Amazon.com, Inc.** (NASDAQ: AMZN) is breaking out. He would buy the stock.'
 'Monthly subscription services provided by firms like **Netflix Inc.** (NASDAQ: NFLX) and **Amazon.com Inc.** (NASDAQ: AMZN) have changed the landscape of television and put big name networks at risk. Not only have such offerings pulled viewers away from traditional cable, but the two companies\' forays into original programming turned into a smash success. Both firms have produced award-winning tv series, leading writers to flock to subscription-based services before pitching their ideas to major networks. This ability to turn the TV industry on its head has done big things for both companies\' bottom lines, and now they are setting their sights on the silver screen. **Netflix Debuts Movie Making Prowess** Netflix recently debut its first feature film, "Beasts of No Nation" on its streaming service and in select theaters across the US. The film was unable to find a major studio producer, but was snapped up by Netflix for $12 million as the company began its efforts to make smaller, lower budget films. Amazon similarly is planning its own movie debut with a project from director Spike Lee later this year. **A New Kind Of Movie Machine** Netflix premiered "Beasts of No Nation" at only a handful of US theaters, in large part because most were unwilling to shell out for a film that was also available in viewers\' homes. Because the film was made available to stream at home on the same day it hit theaters, the turnout was lackluster. Netflix was unfazed by the criticism, saying that its ultimate goal for the film was to get it out it in time to be a contender for the Academy Awards. Netflix says its movie making career is intended to make good movies and keep subscribers happy rather than to make money at the box office. Amazon is planning to do things a little bit differently by withholding its movies from its streaming service for several weeks while the films play in theaters. **Attracting Talent** By taking the pressure of box office numbers out of the equation, Netflix is fostering space where creative directors can work on projects they feel passionate about and giving them the ability to make films the way they believe they should be made. This approach is likely to bring in a great deal of talent as the company sources its upcoming films. So far, Netflix has already signed up to produce four Adam Sandler films as well as a Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon sequel and Amazon is promising around a dozen original films in the coming year. Many expect that this unconventional production method will create award winning content that mirrors the success the firms have had in the TV space. **Will The System Work?** It remains to be seen whether or not Netflix will receive a nod from the Academy, but many analysts say the quality of the movies that companies like Amazon and Netflix make may not be the most important metric. For both firms, bringing in and retaining subscribers is a vital part of their business. At the moment, it is unclear whether or not their original programming is making large enough of an impact to justify the costs of creating new shows, but spending on movie making is a much larger gamble. Some analysts say that both firms would be better off using their movie budgets to make new TV series, which can be changed depending on viewers\' reactions. Movies, once made, are either a hit or a flop, and making them is a larger financial gamble. \n\n  * The European Union completed a 15 month investigation into multi-national companies setting up tax shelters. \n  * The report noted **Starbucks Corporation** (NASDAQ: SBUX) made the Netherlands its European hub while **Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV** (NYSE: FCAU) takes advantage of an internal financing subsidiary in Luxembourg.\n  * The commission concluded that these two tax rulings constitute illegal state aid and its investigation will expand to other multinational giants.\n\nStarbucks and Fiat Chrysler\'s European operations have been a focal point of a 15 month long investigation by the European Union. The investigation focused on Starbucks\' naming the Netherlands as its home base while Fiat has gained tax benefits by using an internal financing subsidiary in Luxembourg. According to The Guardian, Margrethe Vestager, the Competition Commission, concluded that both Starbucks and Fiat are illegally benefiting from state aid. The report alleged that Starbucks artificially inflated the internal price at which its Dutch roaster purchased its coffee beans from another Starbucks company based in Switzerland. The company took advantage of favorable tax treatments that are available in the Netherlands. Starbucks could receive a tax bill of around 30 million euros, according to sources cited by The Financial Times. A decision against Fiat\'s similar "sweetheart tax deal" is expected to be more costly. Investors should be made aware that while Starbucks and Fiat were the subject of an initial investigation, the committee is preparing to investigation similar tax avoidance allegations involving **Apple Inc.** (NASDAQ: AAPL)\'s offices in Ireland and **Amazon.com, Inc.** (NASDAQ: AMZN)\'s tax affairs in Luxembourg. \n\n  * Bob Peck of SunTrust previewed **Alphabet Inc** (NASDAQ: GOOG)\'s and **Amazon.com, Inc.** (NASDAQ: AMZN)\'s third quarter results.\n  * Peck noted that Alphabet\'s results will be "overshadowed" by investor focus on the additional disclosures on Q4 following the reorganization. \n  * Peck is expecting Amazon to report a "strong" quarter following its "A+" second quarter print.\n\nBob Peck of SunTrust Robinson Humphrey previewed Alphabet\'s and Amazon\'s third quarter results. **Alphabet: Reorganization To ‘Overshadow\' Q3 Results** Alphabet is scheduled to report its third quarter results after Thursday\'s market close. Peck is expecting the company to report revenue of $15.2 billion (versus Street estimate of $15 billion) while unfavorable foreign exchange rates continue to pressure the top line. The analyst lowest his EBITDA estimate to $7.5 billion from a prior $7.6 billion. Peck continued that while his revenue estimate assumes a "strong" 13 percent year over year growth, the company\'s results will likely be "overshadowed" by investor focus on the additional disclosures that are set to begin in the fourth quarter following the firm\'s reorganization under the new Alphabet structure. Peck added that the new structure should allow for a "greater investor focus" on the core revenue and profit drivers while offering more visibility towards the future. Shares remain Buy rated with an unchanged $770 price target. **Amazon: Top Line Growth To Continue** Amazon is also scheduled to report its third quarter results after Thursday\'s market close. According to Peck, his $24.585 billion revenue estimate (representing a growth of around 20 percent year over year) is "reasonable" based on ChannelAdvisor data. The analyst noted that growth in the quarter was supported by "exceptional" performance on Prime Day. However, Peck added that Amazon has a "history of giving back" operational efficiencies to consumers through lower prices and "aggressively" investing to drive long-term free cash flow growth. Some of the initiatives include focus on marketplaces, Prime, and AWS. Accordingly, the analyst is expecting the company\'s margins to "trend lower" from the fourth quarter onwards and the stock will trade sideways. Shares remain Neutral with an unchanged $550 price target. Amazon.com, Inc.

 'Shares **Amazon.com, Inc.**(NASDAQ: AMZN) rose more than 10 percent on Thursday\'s after-hours trading session, following the announcement of the company\'s third quarter financial results. The online retailer rose on an earnings beat and strong guidance.\n\nThird quarter earnings came in at $0.17 per share on revenue of $25.358, well above the Street\'s expectations. In fact, experts were modeling a consensus net loss of ($0.10) per share on sales of $24.851 billion.\n\nShares of **Alphabet Inc**(NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG), formerly Google, also rose about 10 percent since the bell rang. The tech giant reported earnings of $7.35 per share on revenue of $15.109 billion, beating the Steet\'s consensus estimate of $7.25 per share and $15.087 billion.\n\nAlso moving on its earnings report was **Microsoft Corporation**(NASDAQ: MSFT), up roughly 5 percent since the market closed. The maker of Windows OS delivered earnings of $0.67 per share on revenue of $21.66 billion, beating experts\' forecasts, which called for earnings of $0.57 per share on sales of $21.23 billion.\n\nOn the other hand, **Pandora Media Inc**(NYSE: P) fell more than 15 percent since the bell rang - on a poor earnings report. The Internet radio company retrieved a net loss ($0.40) per share on revenue of $311.6 million, below the Street\'s expectations for earnings of $0.10 per share and revenue of $312.39 billion.\n\nFinally, there\'s **Skechers USA Inc**(NYSE: SKX), which fell approximately 25 percent on its financial results. The Street was projecting consensus earnings of $0.54 per share on revenue of $868.4 million. However, EPS came in at $0.43, and revenue, at $856.2 million.\n\n \n\n_Disclosure: Javier Hasse holds no positions in any of the securities mentioned above._\n\nShares of **Amazon.com, Inc.** (NASDAQ: AMZN) jumped over 12 percent in after-hours trading after the company reported a surprise profit for the third quarter on Thursday. The Seattle, Washington-based company reported a quarterly profit of $79 million, or $0.17 per share, versus a year-ago loss of $437 million, or $0.95 per share. Its total net sales climbed 23.2 percent to $25.36 billion. However, analysts were expecting a loss of $0.13 per share on revenue of $24.91 billion. The average estimate among 359 Estimize users was for a loss of $0.04 per share and revenue of $24.92 billion. Its operating income for the latest quarter came in at $406 million, versus operating loss of $544 million in the year-ago quarter. For the fourth quarter, Amazon.com expects net sales of $33.50 billion to $36.75 billion and operating income of $80 million to $1.28 billion. Amazon.com shares jumped 12.51 percent to $634.46 in the after-hours trading session. \n\nIf we asked what two S&P 500 tech stocks had posted the best performance this year through mid-October, it wouldn\'t be a stretch to think the savvy among you could come up with **Netflix, Inc.** (NASDAQ: NFLX) and **Amazon.com, Inc.**(NASDAQ: AMZN).\n\nBut would you care to guess at Nos. 3 and 4?\n\nAs contributor Jon Markman recently pointed out in a piece for Forbes, the intriguing answer is two video game companies: **Activision Blizzard, Inc.**(NASDAQ: ATVI), which is up nearly 70% in 2015, and **Electronic Arts Inc.** (NASDAQ: EA), which has increased more than 52%.\n\nOther video game investments have climbed, too: The Online Gaming World motif (where shares of ATVI and EA have a 45.1% weight) has risen 57.7% in the past 12 months. In that same time, the S&P 500 has gained 7.8%.\n\nOver the past month, Online Gaming World has increased 8.5%; the S&P 500 is up 2.2%.\n\nAs Markman noted, the reason this market may not have come to mind is that investors may not appreciate its sheer size.\n\nTech research firm Gartner sees the worldwide videogame market of console, online, mobile and PC products at $111 billion by 2016 and $128 billion in 2017, Markman wrote. Compare that to the film industry, which had $88 billion in worldwide revenue in 2015, according to PwC.\n\nAnother sign of video games\' massive appeal: Activision is boosting its investment in the "eSports" popularity surrounding its mega-hit Call of Duty game, each version of which regularly earns $1 billion at retail.\n\nAs Activision has figured out, releasing the game itself is just one piece of the revenue component -- there\'s also attempting to improve engagement by fostering appeal in worldwide competition, both for in-game players and those wanting to watch the action.\n\nThe company is overseeing a new Call of Duty World League, which includes separate professional (Pro) and amateur (Challenge) divisions that will feed into the Call of Duty Championship. The new league kicks off in January 2016 with Call of Duty: Black Ops 3 and runs through the fall championship. The game publisher has also expanded its prize pool from $1 million annually to over $3 million beginning in 2016.\n\nAs a Barrons.com article pointed out earlier this year, online games are proliferating due to the recent explosive growth of mobile devices -- and mobile gaming shows no sign of slowing. That\'s especially true in China, where only half the population has Internet access, but among those who do, three out of five "netizens" consider themselves gamers.\n\nIn 2014, Chinese online gaming revenues jumped nearly 35% year-over-year to $18.5 billion. Of that, 24% came from the fast-growing mobile segment, up from 13.5% in 2013. By 2016, market research firm NewZoo thinks China\'s mobile game industry will surpass even that of the US, Barrons.com said.\n\nOne key Chinese player is **NetEase Inc.** (NASDAQ: NTES), which has an 18.4% weighting in the Online Gaming World motif. NetEase\'s online game services account for about 80% of its total revenue - up from less than 20% some 15 years ago. Just two years ago, the company brought its first mobile game to market, and today mobile is among its faster-growing and most promising segments, driving 20% of the online gaming business, up from just 9% mid-2014.\n\nAs Barrons.com described it, NetEase has accomplished its growth by developing a loyal following of hard-core gamers with its MMORPGs - "massively multi-player online role-playing games" - including its flagship game Fantasy Westward Journey. While these games take more time to develop, they also have a longer shelf life and lure gamers who play for hours at a time and pay to advance to the next level.\n\nThe mobile version of Fantasy Westward Journey, a 10-year-old game, vaulted to the No. 1 spot in Chinese iOS app stores within hours of its March 26 launch, and, more importantly, hadn\'t relinquished that top seat three months later.\n\nAs the holidays approach, new titles may help sustain the rally in video game stocks once initial sales results filter through. According to a recent Nielsen survey, Activison\'s upcoming Black Ops 3 is the most anticipated video game this season.4\n\nA sales outperformance there could continue the solid returns for long-term video-game investors.\n\nE-commerce and cloud giant--and now, original programming creator--**Amazon.com, Inc.**(NASDAQ: AMZN) turns in its Q3 results after the market\'s close today. Results are expected to be colored by Amazon\'s diversification initiatives, as it continues to challenge traditional retailer models. With Amazon\'s expenses, however, comes the expectation for another loss.\n\nThomson Reuters\' surveyed analysts, on average, expect AMZN Q3 revenue up 21% to $24.9 billion compared to a year earlier. They expect a loss-per-share of $0.12. That\'s typical for AMZN, which has heavily reinvested in the firm. In fact, in the past 14 quarters, only eight have been in the black. And yet AMZN has met or outpaced Wall Street expectations in three of the last four quarters. That includes surprise Q2 profit of $92 million on sales of $23.18 billion. The Street may be more interested in comparing this Q3 to Q2\'s surprise rather than the typical year-over-year match up.\n\nAs for the big picture, industry analysts remind us that AMZN\'s business model is not just that of an online retailer mimicking traditional bricks-and-mortar stores. Its members-with-benefits program Amazon Prime and its cloud-computing Amazon Web Services are far from any gear you\'d see at the corner department store. They\'re just two examples of the enterprises that AMZN is using, it says, to further engage customers and differentiate from retailers that include the online divisions of Wal-Mart (WMT), Target (TGT), Overstock.com (OSTK), and others. The firm that some observers call an e-commerce-turned-everything provider is clearly taking on the tech giants in the fight for cloud positioning, too. In fact, some tech is trying to catch up to Amazon; one of which, Microsoft (MSFT), also reports after the close (more on it below).\n\nBank of America Merrill Lynch estimates that Amazon\'s cloud-based web services division could swell by 78% year over year and generate some $2.08 billion in sales. Web services is likely to be marginal in the company\'s current revenue, so the most useful information may come with any forward-looking company commentary on what it thinks could be a potentially high-margin division.\n\nAMZN joins other online commerce firms issuing quarterly results this week. **eBay** (NASDAQ: EBAY) in its Wednesday release--the first after a split from PayPal (PYPL)--reported a drop in profit that was less than Wall Street expected. The auction site lifted its forecast. It now expects profit at between $1.58 and $1.60 per share for all of 2015 compared with a forecast just three months ago in a range of $1.40 to $1.45.\n\nA look at the limited options volume around this stock reveals that AMZN\'s implied volatility is at an elevated 84th percentile. The short-term options market is pricing in a potential 8.5% move in either direction for the stock around its earnings release, according to the Market Maker Move indicator on TD Ameritrade\'s thinkorswim® platform.\n\nAMZN\'s stock has been moving in the upper end of a 52-week range spanning roughly $284-$580 (figure 1).\n\nCloud in Focus for Microsoft, Too\n\n**Microsoft Corporation**(NASDAQ: MSFT) cloud business also will be top of mind for analysts when the technology giant reports fiscal Q1 results after the close.\n\nLike other legacy tech companies, MSFT is transitioning from a PC-based business to a commercial cloud-based enterprise with products including its Azure and Office 365. Analysts reporting to Thomson Reuters are projecting declining revenue and earnings for the quarter. On the top line, the average forecast is for a 10% year-over-year pullback on revenues to $20.96 billion. The bottom line is anticipated to shrink by 13% to $0.59 per share.\n\nLike most multinationals, MSFT is expected to feel the brunt of the stronger dollar\'s pinch on its overseas performance. In last quarter\'s report, the company said its revenue tumbled 5% but the decline was only 2% on a constant-currency basis that eliminates foreign exchange fluctuations.\n\nThe short-term options market is pricing in the chance of a 5% move in either direction for this stock around its earnings release, according to the Market Maker Move indicator on TD Ameritrade\'s thinkorswim® platform. The weekly 50 calls are active, while the Oct 43 puts that expire on Friday are seeing three times the normal amount of interest. Note: Call options represent the right, but not the obligation, to buy the underlying security at a predetermined price and over a set period of time; the same applies to put options, which represent the right, but not the obligation, to sell the underlying security at a predetermined price over a set period of time.\n\nAT&T: What\'s Next for DirecTV?\n\nTelecom **AT &T Inc.** (NYSE: T) joins the Q3 earnings parade after the closing bell. Industry analyst are looking for a 23% jump in revenues compared to a year earlier, thanks in part to T\'s acquisition of DirecTV in July. The buy positioned T as the largest pay-television company in the U.S.\n\nAnalysts reporting to Thomson Reuters expect top line sales to jump to $40.6 billion from $33 billion reported in the year-ago period. On a per-share basis, analysts are looking for $0.69 compared with the $0.63 AT&T made last year.\n\nAn AT&T spokesman on Wednesday issued a statement that said Wall Street\'s earnings prognosticators are miscalculating revenue around the accounting for the DirecTV deal. The spokesman said Q3 revenue will likely miss Wall Street\'s general consensus as a result.\n\nThe telecom industry has been in a dog-eat-dog battle for customers this year and industry analysts admit they are hungry for any insight T offers on its metrics compared with its biggest rival Verizon (VZ), as well as smaller players **Sprint Corp** (NYSE: S) and **T-Mobile US** (NYSE: TMUS). For instance, analysts are interested in T\'s outlook for DirecTV and plans for its wireless business.\n\nIndustry analysts are also anxious for updates on how things are going in Mexico, where T shelled out more than $4 billion for two carriers earlier this year and said it\'s launching a $3 billion overhaul of its network.\n\nThe short-term options market is pricing in the chance of a 3% move in either direction for this stock around its earnings release, according to the thinkorswim® platform\'s Market Maker Move indicator. Options trading volume early on Thursday was almost three times the norm. The call and put activity is about evenly split, with weekly 33 puts and weekly 34 calls both drawing interest. See its recent stock activity in figure 3.\n\n_Inclusion of specific security names in this commentary does not constitute a recommendation from TD Ameritrade to buy, sell, or hold._\n\n_Market volatility, volume, and system availability may delay account access and trade executions._\n\n_Past performance of a security or strategy does not guarantee future results or success._\n\n_Options are not suitable for all investors as the special risks inherent to options trading may expose investors to potentially rapid and substantial losses.

Used with permission._\n\nBroad stock indexes have a shot at the first higher finish in three days if early indicators hold. That\'s after Wednesday\'s deal-driven and IPO-fueled early gains fizzled by the final bell. Wednesday\'s turn south was led by losses in the S&P 500\'s (SPX) health care sector, and may not have reflected broad-market sentiment.\n\nIf so, that could set the course for a mild Thursday rebound even as a busy earnings week continues with mostly mixed results. Global diversions are also in play. Asian markets gained as Chinese stock averages responded with a mild bounce to Wednesday\'s unexpectedly sharp retreat. Financial media reported central bank liquidity moves likely helped restore short-term market confidence there. According to those reports, the People\'s Bank of China injected the equivalent of $16.6 billion through medium-term lending facilities.\n\nChina\'s isn\'t the only overseas market under closer watch in the U.S. All eyes turn to European Central Bank President Mario Draghi\'s policy meeting. The ECB today opted to leave its stimulus policy untouched but Draghi said they\'ll revisit the issue in December. That rhetoric was in line with industry economists\' expectations. They generally expected Draghi to keep the door open to more stimulus, but stop short today of announcing any new policy measures. European stocks remained higher in light of that open-minded stance.\n\n**CAT Cuts Outlook. Caterpillar** (NYSE: CAT) reported a 64% drop in Q3 profit on weaker demand from global mining and energy firms. Those results pushed the company to slash its full-year profit estimates. CAT is now expecting profit of about $4.60 a share, excluding restructuring costs, for 2015. It had previously forecast an adjusted profit of $5 per share. CAT already cut its revenue view and announced job cuts in September so the quarter likely surprised few on Wall Street. As for other industrials, **Dow Chemical**(NYSE: DOW) shares gain following its earnings and buyback news; 3M (MMM) beats the Street view with its profit results but cuts its outlook and announces job reductions.\n\n**McDonald \'s Scores Turnaround Points.** **McDonald \'s Corporation** (NYSE: MCD) shares are early gainers after the fast-food giant beat profit and sales expectations. One key metric, global same-store sales increased 4%, better than a Street-forecast 1.7% growth. According to management: "Third quarter marked an important step in the company\'s global turnaround--the reorganization of our business from a geographically focused structure to business segments that combine markets with similar characteristics and opportunities for growth. As we begin fourth quarter, comparable sales are expected to be positive in all segments." The stock has climbed just over 9% year to date, outpacing the Dow Jones Industrial Average\'s 3.7% drop in the same period.\n\n**Will Amazon Deliver?** **Amazon.com, Inc.**(NASDAQ: AMZN) is on the busy post-close earnings calendar. Thomson Reuters\' surveyed analysts, on average, expect AMZN Q3 revenue up 21% to $24.9 billion compared to a year earlier. They expect a loss-per-share of $0.12. That\'s typical for AMZN, which has heavily reinvested in the firm. In fact, in the past 14 quarters, only eight have been in the black. And yet AMZN has met or outpaced Wall Street expectations in three of the last four quarters, including Q2\'s upside surprise.\n\n_Inclusion of specific security names in this commentary does not constitute a recommendation from TD Ameritrade to buy, sell, or hold._\n\n_Market volatility, volume, and system availability may delay account access and trade executions._\n\n_Past performance of a security or strategy does not guarantee future results or success._\n\n_Options are not suitable for all investors as the special risks inherent to options trading may expose investors to potentially rapid and substantial losses.

 'Heading into a trading week packed with a pivotal Federal Reserve meeting and another flutter of earnings news, major stock averages have now retraced about half of the "panic selloff" that rocked a sleepy August.\n\nThe S&P 500 (SPX), pushed above 2070 on Friday, sits above its August 25 closing low, but is still 4.6% below its May 21 record high (figure 1). The drop in SPX has paired with a 41% drop over three months for the CBOE Volatility Index (VIX), one measure of broad-market jitters (figure 2).\n\nThat fairly quick recovery may leave stock averages vulnerable to profit taking should this coming week\'s earnings fail to reach the bar set when a trio of technology heavies--**Microsoft Corporation**(NASDAQ: MSFT), Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL), and **Amazon.com, Inc.** (NASDAQ: AMZN)--largely beat Street expectations.\n\nIn fact, that threesome capped a week that featured mostly encouraging earnings news across select industrials and consumer companies. Analyst sentiment on Q3 earnings has improved thanks to a string of stronger-than-expected results from blue-chips. It appears that Wall Street analysts, and perhaps investors, are getting used to reports tinted by a global economic slowing and a strong dollar\'s dent on multinationals\' profits. Estimates and share prices may better reflect corporate reality, inviting mostly upside surprises when the numbers are off target.\n\n### Delicate Situation For The Fed\n\nCompany-focused news will share the marquee with a two-day Fed gathering that at one time was considered to be all but a lock for an interest rate hike. No so true anymore. The strong dollar, China-triggered global growth worries, and inconsistent U.S. economic indicators have potentially sidelined the central bank\'s plans to reverse recession-era interest rate levels. For now.\n\nThe Fed wraps its two-day session with a statement at 2 p.m. Eastern on Wednesday, October 28. The majority of Fed watchers expect no action from the panel then, but market-driving news could still emerge especially if the Fed lays any groundwork for its December meeting and early 2016.\n\nThe CME Group\'s FedWatch Tool, calculated based on pricing in the Fed funds futures market, shows traders are pricing in about a 7% chance the Fed moves next week to raise rates for the first time since 2006. The tool shows about a 39% shot for a rate hike in December and a 60% chance for a hike in March.\n\nThe Fed--with rhetoric that indicates it\'s poised to raise rates at the first sign the U.S. is back on track--is a rogue among its central bank brethren. Most other large-nation central banks are either cutting rates--China cut benchmark lending rates on Friday for the sixth time in roughly a year--or have shown little intention to remove ultra-loose policy anytime soon. Just last week, the European Central Bank (ECB) made it clear that extra stimulus measures are still on the table as needed. The Bank of Japan is holding its own monetary policy meeting on Oct. 30.\n\nA couple of economic indicators could be of particular importance to a convening Fed. On Tuesday, durable goods data hits. It can be a useful indicator for gauging whether improving hiring trends are producing the kind of wages that translate into big-ticket spending. The first look at Q3 gross domestic product (GDP), the broadest measure of the economy\'s health, hits the tape on Thursday (see the full economic calendar in figure 3 below).\n\n### Shiny Apple?\n\n### \n\nCome Tuesday post-close, **Apple Inc.**(NASDAQ: AAPL) is in the hot seat. Can it repeat the general upbeat tone delivered for other big-name tech this earnings round? Investor expectations could be running high for any management chatter on expected holiday sales. Investors will also be dissecting iPhone upgrade sales against the risk that a global slowdown has eaten into sales.\n\nA poll of analysts by S&P Capital IQ shows a consensus of 40 analysts looking for $1.29 per share in AAPL\'s fiscal Q4, up from $1.18 a year earlier. The survey pegs revenue at $39.4 billion, up from $37.5 billion a year earlier.\n\n### Plenty More Earnings, Too\n\nMonday\'s earnings line-up is lengthy and features a trio of pharmaceutical giants: **Bristol Myers Squibb** (NYSE: BMY),**Pfizer** (NYSE: PFE), and**Merck & Co., Inc.** (NYSE: MRK), a sector that could continue to draw interest as the political climate heats up. Tuesday also features results from **Twitter Inc** (NYSE: TWTR) as Wall Street continues to rate its leadership shuffle. Other social media earnings releases include **LinkedIn Corp** (NYSE: LNKD) on Thursday.**Facebook Inc** (NASDAQ: FB) is up with its results on November 4.\n\nThe energy sector has seemingly been off the radar for a few weeks but that could change as **Exxon Mobil Corporation** (NYSE: XOM) and **Chevron**(NYSE: CVX) release results on Friday. U.S.-traded crude fell to a three-week low, widening its discount to Europe-traded Brent. Prices recently tried but failed to test $50 a barrel again as U.S. inventories expanded for a fourth week through Oct. 16, keeping supplies more than 100 million barrels above the five-year seasonal average, according to the Energy Information Administration.\n\nInclusion of specific security names in this commentary does not constitute a recommendation from TD Ameritrade to buy, sell, or hold.

(NYSE:WMT)** stock could be a value trap at current prices.  \n• Wal-Mart has been mostly ignoring competition from online rival **Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN)** in recent years.  \n• Wal-Mart\'s P/E ratio is well below the S&P 500 average, but its PEG ratio reveals that growth is the company\'s biggest problem._  \n  \nHedge fund manager Whitney Tilson is the latest to weigh in on Wal-Mart\'s recently-announced plan to turn its operations around by investing heavily in online sales. Wal-Mart\'s shares are down big since the company made the announcement, but Tilson believes that buyers should beware of a value trap.  \n  \n**Losing battle**  \nIt\'s no secret that Wal-Mart has been losing market share to online rival Amazon. This year alone, Wal-Mart\'s stock is down 30 percent, while Amazon\'s is up 80 percent.  \n  \n**Tilson \'s comments**  \nTilson believes that buyers should be leery of rushing in to buy Wal-Mart on the dip.  \n  \n"What should Walmart have done over the past two decades to prevent the current state of affairs?" Tilson asked. "More relevantly, what can it do today? I\'m not sure there\'s anything it can do, which is why I\'m not buying its stock, despite it looking awfully cheap. It smells like a value trap."  \n  \n**The numbers**  \nIf the market continues to reward growth over earnings like it has in recent years, Wal-Mart shareholders could be in trouble. Amazon\'s stock is one of the top performers in the entire market in 2015, despite a P/E ratio of 868.1. Walmart\'s P/E ratio is only 12.2, well below the S&P 500 average.  \n  \nWhen growth rates are factored in, however, Wal-Mart\'s PEG ratio of 4.2 exposes the company\'s true problem- weak growth. Amazon\'s incredibly lofty PEG ratio of 24.5 is yet another example of the market\'s disregard for value in the face of Amazon\'s strong growth projections.  \n  \n_Disclosure: the author holds no position in the stocks mentioned._\n\nOn Tuesday, **Apple Inc.** (NASDAQ: AAPL), still the largest U.S. company by market capitalization, reports fiscal fourth-quarter earnings.\n\n \n\n"The iPhone and Apple Watch maker will post earnings of $1.91 per share for its fiscal fourth quarter, if Estimize\'s consensus forecast is accurate. That would be up from $1.42 per share in the year-ago period. Wall Street is looking for EPS of $1.88 for the quarter, as well as $9.13 for the full year," reports Benzinga. \n\n \n\nFew if any earnings reports are as widely anticipated and highly scrutinized as Apple\'s. Plus, the company faces heady earnings competition as rivals **Amazon.com Inc.** (NASDAQ: AMZN), **Alphabet Inc.** (NASDAQ: GOOG) and **Microsoft Corp.** (NASDAQ: MSFT) delivered boffo results last week. Not to mention, analysts and investors will be eagerly listening to what the iPhone maker has to say about December quarter iPhone sales estimates.\n\n \n\nWith all that to consider, it is arguably surprising that Apple-heavy exchange traded funds have recently been docile, at least in terms of inflows. Perhaps the best of saying that is "Inflows?" because two of the ETFs with some of the largest weights to shares of Apple have recently seen modest outflows.\n\n \n\nFor example, the **Technology Select Sector SPDR** (NYSE: XLK), the larges technology sector ETF, has lost almost $56 million in assets this month. That is a small slice of XLK\'s $12.2 billion assets under management, but it could be seen as a commentary on what investors are expecting out of Apple\'s earnings reports when considering XLK allocates almost 15.8 percent of its weight to Apple. That is about 620 basis points more than XLK\'s weight to Microsoft, the ETF\'s second-largest holding. \n\n \n\nThe **Vanguard Information Technology ETF** (NYSE: VGT), which has a 15.5 percent weight to shares of Apple, has lost $2.8 million. VGT, one of the least expensive tech ETFs with an annual expense ratio of 0.12 percent, features Apple as its largest holding to the tune of 640 basis points over Alphabet. \n\n \n\nWhile there have been modest departures this quarter from XLK and VGT, investors have added $26.5 million to the **iShares U.S. Technology ETF** (NYSE: IYW). With an Apple weight of almost 18.6 percent, the $2.68 billion IYW has more Apple exposure than any other ETF.\n\n \n\nThe one Apple that has legitimately shined in terms of fourth-quarter inflows is the **PowerShares QQQ** (NASDAQ: QQQ). QQQ, the NASDAQ-100 tracking ETF, has a 12.8 percent weight to Apple, putting the iPad maker ahead of Microsoft by 480 basis points in the ETF. Investors have added $1.17 billion in new asset to QQQ this quarter.\n\n \n\nHowever, it can be debated whether those inflows are in anticipation of Apple\'s Tuesday earnings report or in reaction to the results delivered by Alphabet, Amazon and Microsoft. Those three stocks combine for almost 22 percent of QQQ\'s weight.'
 '* _**Etsy Inc** (NASDAQ: ETSY) has seen a 62.43 percent decline in its share price year to date, touching a low of $10.68 on October 21._\n  * _Brean Capital \'s Tom Forte has reiterated a Buy rating on the company, with a price target of $23._\n  * _Forte expects the company to report robust 3Q15 results, while also commenting on the entry of**Amazon.com, Inc.** (NASDAQ: AMZN) into its territory and Etsy\'s third party manufacturing initiative._\n\n\n\nAnalyst Tom Forte also believes that the pullback in the stock, following the entry of Amazon.com, has created an attractive buying opportunity.\n\nWith regard to the 3Q results, Forte expects the company to report total sales growth of 40.8 percent, with revenue of $67 million, slightly ahead of the consensus. Seller Services revenue is expected to increase 67.8 percent, with Marketplaces expanding 22.7 percent and Other growing 14 percent.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA is, however, expected to decline 26.1 percent, as compared to a year ago, driven by advertising and headcount spend. "We acknowledge the potential risk to the stock\'s short-term performance if adjusted EBITDA meets our forecast and comes in below the consensus figure," Forte said.\n\nHowever, the company is likely to post its GAAP EPS loss in-line with the consensus. According to the FBR report, active buyers are expected to have increased to 23.8 million during the quarter, with active sellers growing to 1.6 million.\n\n"Given the entry of Amazon.com, we believe investors will place even more scrutiny on Etsy\'s active seller growth quarter-to-date since the official launch of Handmade at Amazon," the report added.\n\n  * Shares of **Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.** (NYSE: WMT) continue to decline, touching a new 52-week low of $57.97 on Monday.\n  * Wal-Mart said that it is in investment mode to improve its eCommerce platform.\n  * The company filed paperwork with the Federal Aviation Administration to test a drone delivery system\n\nShares of Wal-Mart hit a new 52-week low of $57.97 on Monday as investors appear to be losing confidence in the company\'s ability to deliver growth, especially in the eCommerce segment where it lags competitors. Wal-Mart has already disclosed that it will be spending billions of dollars to improve its eCommerce offering but few suspected the company would be entering the drone space. Reuters was first to report that Wal-Mart submitted the necessary paperwork with US regulators to test drones for home delivery, curbside pickup and checking warehouse inventories. In fact, the company has already been testing drones indoors and appears to be ready to test its drones outdoors. Reuters added that the documents Wal-Mart submitted to the FAA request permission to test its drones for "deliveries to customers at Wallmart facilities, as well as to consumer homes." Wal-Mart said its initial tests would use drones for taking stock of trailers and other items in the parking lot of a warehouse using electronic tagging. The company also wants to test drones for its grocery pickup service. The retailer is working with drones manufacturing by China-based SZ DJI Technology Co Ltd. Commercial drone use remains illegal, though companies can apply with the FAA for an exemption. So far, the FAA has granted more than 2,100 exemptions. Wal-Mart isn\'t the first retailer to eye drones as a method of delivery. **Amazon.com, Inc.** (NASDAQ: AMZN) has already said it would be ready to use drones as a delivery method as soon as federal rules would allow the company to do legally.'
 '* Steve Mandel\'s Lone Pine Capital told its investors in a letter dated October 14 that the fund had a "tough third quarter."\n  * Mandel did however state that recent "sharp" declines in the equity market has created the "potential for outsized appreciation."\n  * The fund\'s objective remains: "to invest in innovation, but above all, we invest in people"\n\nSteve Mandel of Lone Pine Capital told investors in a letter dated October 14 that the hedge fund "had a tough quarter" with all of the losses occurring in the last week of the quarter which erased "previously solid results." The fund\'s Lone Cypress lost 3.5 percent in the third quarter, Lone Kauri lost 3.6 percent, Lone Tamarack lost 3.7 percent while Lone Cascade lost 9.6 percent. Over the same time period, the S&P; 500 lost 6.4 percent while the MSCI World Index declined 8.3 percent. However, the recent "sharp" declines in the equities market has presented the "potential for outsized appreciation" over the coming years. The fund highlighted that it added to its investments in merging natural gas pipeline companies **Energy Transfer Equity LP** (NYSE: ETE) and **Williams Companies Inc** (NYSE: WMB). Both stocks fell along with the entire energy sector, despite both companies economics "having very little to do with the price of oil." Mandel continued that specialty pharmaceutical stocks have fallen "over what we believe to be misplaced concerns" about potential drug price regulations. The fund manager highlighted his investments in **Allergan PLC** (NYSE: AGN), **Horizon Pharma PLC** (NASDAQ: HZNP), **Shire PLC (ADR)** (NASDAQ: SHPG), and **Valeant Pharmaceuticals Intl Inc** (NYSE: VRX) are all trading between 10x and 15x next year\'s earnings and these earnings should grow at a double-digit rate which "should drive very healthy returns." Mandel stated that his fund also holds "significant" positions in several "internet disrupters," including **Amazon.com, Inc.** (NASDAQ: AMZN), **Expedia Inc** (NASDAQ: EXPE), **Facebook Inc** (NASDAQ: FB), **JD.Com Inc(ADR)** (NASDAQ: JD), and **Priceline Group Inc** (NASDAQ: PCLN) which also happens to be the fund\'s single largest holding at 5.3 percent of total equities. The fund also invested in **Mobileye NV** (NYSE: MBLY), an Israeli-based "disruptor" within the automotive market that develops software that controls active safety features (automatic emergency braking, lane keeping assist) and more advanced semi-autonomous functions in a car. "We invest in innovation, but above all, we invest in people – managers who are driving value by running their business well and allocating capital appropriately," Mandel concluded. "In many cases, this means investing behind the innovators described earlier or behind managers who are sustaining and improving existing strong franchises."'
 'While earnings season is still in full swing, enough companies have released in order to provide traders with a clear picture of how the market has been performing. The third quarter has been a disappointing one for most firms, leading analysts to predict that combined earnings for S&P; 500 companies will be down -2.7 percent from the same period last year. **What Happened?** A stronger dollar has limited the success for many US firms, who have seen the greenback\'s strength eat away at their margins. Slower economic activity has also weighed on many firm\'s bottom lines and low oil prices took their toll on energy stocks. **Were There Any Bright Spots?** While this quarter\'s earnings season has painted a gloomy picture, there were some sectors that appeared to be weathering the storm. The tech sector has a particularly strong performance with **Apple Inc.**(NASDAQ: AAPL), **Microsoft Corp**(NASDAQ: MSFT) and Google\'s parent firm **Alphabet** (NASDAQ: GOOG) all showing solid growth. Airline stocks also came out on top with low oil prices boosting their margins. **American Airlines Group**(NASDAQ: AAL), **United Continental Holdings** (NYSE: UAL), **Delta Airlines** (NYSE: DAL) and **Southwest Airlines** (NYSE: LUV) saw passenger numbers increase as more people traveled at the same time that their expenses decreased. **Stocks That Rallied** While earnings reports as a whole may have missed the mark, that doesn\'t mean that investors haven\'t been reacting to guidance. Several stocks have seen huge movements over the past few days following upbeat reports. The technology and healthcare sectors have seen the largest positive swings, with several companies gaining more than 20 percent during the 24 hours following their earnings release. **NETGEAR** (NASDAQ: NTGR) beat its earnings and revenue forecast and saw its stock increase 28.87 percent on its earnings reaction date. Other impressive performances from the tech sector included a 21.29 percent increase from **Gigamon Inc.**(NYSE: GIMO) and a 20.36 percent increase from **QLogic Corporation**(NASDAQ: QLGC). In the healthcare space, **athenahealth, Inc.**(NASDAQ: ATHN) gained 26.90 percent following its earnings release and **IGI Labs** saw a 23.44 percent lift. Stocks That Sunk **Pandora Media Inc.**(NYSE: P) has been one of the biggest losers so far this earnings season as the company\'s disappointing third quarter revenue and cautionary guidance led investors to flee from the stock. Following its third quarter earnings release, shares of Pandora lost 35.49 percent. Other firms that also suffered from dismal results were **Skechers USA Inc.**(NYSE: SKX), which fell 34.29 percent and **Apollo Education Group Inc.** (NASDAQ: APOL) which lost 32.22 percent. **What Do The Swings Mean?** Big changes during earnings season can mean different things to different investors. For some, a poor result is reason to sell while for others it can be an opportunity to buy. Long term investors can use times like earnings season to buy companies that are struggling in the current environment, but that they expect to see improve in the long term. Earnings season can also be stressful as some investors may see some of their holdings decline sharply following a lackluster report. However, for a portfolio that is diversified with long term investments, the swings that earnings season brings about shouldn\'t be a cause for concern. **Separating What Matters** Some analysts believe that earnings season is a good time to take a look at which stocks are trading on verifiable strength and which have been artificially inflated by the Fed\'s easy money policies. The market\'s reaction to an earnings report could provide some insight as to whether or not a stock is a strong pick. Regardless of whether or not a company hits or misses its earnings expectations, a positive market reaction suggests that the stock will continue to perform going forward. By this logic, companies like **eBay Inc.**(NASDAQ: EBAY), **Amazon.com Inc.** (NASDAQ: AMZN) and **3M Co** (NASDAQ: MMM) are all destined to continue improving as their earnings results were met with an upbeat reaction. Companies like**Netflix, Inc.**(NASDAQ: NFLX), **YUM! Brands Inc.** (NYSE: YUM) and **Wynn Resorts Limited**(NASDAQ: WYNN) all had poor reactions. \n* GeekWire reported that **Amazon.com, Inc.** (NASDAQ: AMZN) has "quietly" rolled out an e-commerce functionality on its Fire TV devices which may lead to a full scale shopping channel. \n* The report added that a "source with knowledge of the situation" confirmed the experiment has been performing above expectations. \n* Shares of **Liberty Interactive Group** (NASDAQ: QVCA) and **HSN, Inc.** (NASDAQ: HSNI) both lost more than three percent on Thursday.\n\nAccording to a report by GeekWire, Amazon has been "quietly" testing an e-commerce functionality on its Fire TV devices which has been performing above expectations, according to a source with knowledge of the situation. The report continued that Amazon\'s e-commerce tests is part of the company\'s plans to develop its own shipping channel that could rival Liberty Interactive\'s QVC and HSN\'s Home Shopping Network. The channel is expected to roll out this year. Shares of Liberty Interactive and HSN were both lower by more than three percent on Thursday. The issues sold off in unison within an hour of the opening bell. Amazon\'s ambitions appears to be consistent with recent M&A; activity, specifically, its acquisition last year of Twitch, an internet video channel and streaming service for nearly $1 billion. Amazon\'s CEO Jeff Bezos has already stated that his strategy within the hardware business is to "make money when people use our devices, not when they buy our devices." **Wall Street Pros Unconvinced** Victor Anthony, an analyst at Axiom, told Benzinga that Thursday\'s decline in QVC and HSN\'s stock is related to the reports that Amazon plans on infringing in their territory. He stated:"folks are just now paying attention." Anthony\'s statement isn\'t shared by Jason Bazinet, a media analyst at Citi Research. The analyst acknowledged that the decline in the home shopping stocks could be related to the Amazon\'s reports, but it "could certainly be something else."']
