Based on the provided market data and news, predict the LLM’s decision:
News Factors Considered:
['**PayPal Holdings Inc** (NASDAQ:PYPL) made four net additions of U.S. top 500 internet retailers in the second quarter versus **Amazon.com, Inc**  (NASDAQ:AMZN)\'s two merchant adds and Bitcoin\'s flat performance, according to Morgan Stanley. \n\n### The Analyst\n\nJames Faucette maintained an Overweight rating on PayPal Holdings with an unchanged $129 price target.\n\n### The Thesis\n\nPayPal merchant acceptance has improved to 77%, mirroring its consumer penetration, Faucette said in a Thursday note. (See his track record here.) \n\nPayPal\'s net addition of four merchants in the second quarter widened its acceptance lead versus Amazon Pay, the next largest accepted digital wallet, to around 65 percentage points, the analyst said. \n\nThis lead should allow the company to grow total payment volume "at or above the rate of e-commerce (ex-Amazon)," he said. \n\nPayPal should remain "the payment-of-choice for non-Amazon retailers," Faucette said, adding that the company should tap into growth opportunities in the offline market given the consumer confidence and large account base it enjoys in the online space.\n\nMorgan Stanley projects that PayPal\'s second-quarter TPV growth will amount to 24.5% ex-FX. This represents a deceleration from the first quarter due to volume headwinds at eBay, the analyst said. \n\nFaucette said he expects PayPal to report second-quarter total net revenues and operating margins of $4.337 billion and 23%, respectively. He expects EPS to come in at 84 cents, significantly higher than the consensus estimate of 73 cents.\n\nThe consensus projection does not seems to have included gains on equity investments, according to Morgan Stanley. \n\n### Price Action\n\nPayPal shares were trading down slightly at $118.72 at the time of publication Thursday. \n\n_Related Links:  _\n\n_Fintech Focus Rewind: The 1 Thing Every Executive Should Do When Considering Some Sort Of M&A_\n\n_As Facebook Prepares To Launch Libra, Regulators Are Watching_\n\nIf there\'s one thing the market doesn\'t like, it\'s uncertainty. But that\'s what it seems to be getting on two major fronts: the trade dispute between the U.S. and China and corporate earnings.\n\nThe worries about the U.S.-China trade situation continued after President Trump said "there\'s a long way to go" on China trade talks as The Wall Street Journal reported that progress toward a deal between the world\'s two largest economies has stalled over restrictions on Huawei Technologies. \n\nBut Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told CNBC that Huawei wasn\'t a sticking point. He said a call between U.S. and Chinese officials was set for today and could lead to in-person meetings. Still, Mnuchin said "there are just a lot of complicated issues," so it doesn\'t seem like a deal is imminent, meaning that the biggest headwind facing Wall Street seems set to continue for an undetermined amount of time. \n\nWith that uncertainty lurking in the background, earnings season is heating up, and investors have been less than impressed with some early results. \n\n### Earnings Roundup\n\nIn FAANG news, **Netflix, Inc.  **(NASDAQ:NFLX) reported stronger-than-forecast earnings but missed on revenue. Perhaps more importantly, the streaming giant said it lost 126,000 domestic paid subscribers and only added 2.83 million international paid subscribers when Wall Street was expecting many more. Its shares were down more than 11% in early trading this morning.\n\nMeanwhile, **IBM**(NYSE:IBM) posted stronger-than-forecast earnings. But its year-on-year revenue fell for the fourth consecutive quarter as its Global Technology Services segment sales missed expectations even as its Cloud and Cognitive Software unit beat estimates.\n\n**Morgan Stanley** (NYSE:MS) beat on earnings and revenue, but its equities trading business and fixed income trading revenues came in below estimates.\n\n It seems that the gray zone on tariffs may be putting a dent in the trading environment for banks, even as the unknowns on the trade front make the sales environment difficult for other companies. Still, the market remains near all-time highs as some companies beat low expectations.\n\n### Transportation Sector Stalls\n\nThe market yesterday seemed to focus on the negative after rail company **CSX Corporation  **(NASDAQ:CSX) missed analysts estimates for earnings and revenue. The company\'s shares declined more than 10% and were poised for more losses in pre-market trade today. Perhaps more worrisome was that the company trimmed its sales guidance, and its CEO said the current economic environment is "puzzling." (See more below.)\n\nCSX\'s woes, compounded with the latest news reports on the tariff talks stalling, are a reminder that the tariff situation with China hasn\'t gone away. It remains arguably the biggest threat to corporate earnings and the broader economy as concerns about global growth continue to weigh. \n\nWith the economic bellwether Transportation sector not doing well amid worries about the global economy as the trade situation drags on, investors moved into the relative safety of U.S. government debt, pushing yields lower. It seems weaker-than-expected housing starts and building permit data from the U.S. market also encouraged Treasury buying. \n\n### Shades of Beige\n\nStill, not all is doom and gloom, and there have been bright spots, such as the bumper jobs report we saw recently. So you could be forgiven if, along with CSX\'s CEO, you\'re puzzled by the current state of things.\n\nIn its Beige Book, a report summarizing anecdotal business reports, the Fed on Wednesday said that U.S. economic activity from mid-May through early July continued to expand at a modest pace, despite worries about trade. "The outlook generally was positive for the coming months, with expectations of continued modest growth, despite widespread concerns about the possible negative impact of trade-related uncertainty," the Fed said.\n\nAt the same time, the trade situation and its effects on economic growth are behind the Fed\'s anticipated rate cut later this month, something that has given the stock market a shot in the arm recently. \n\nWhile the futures market has been reflecting an increasing probability of a rate cut of 50 basis points in the Fed funds rate, that may be more wishful thinking on the part of some market participants. With the market and consumers seeming to be pretty healthy, it seems more likely that the Fed will be more conservative and issue a 25-basis-points rate cut. \n\nIn one sign that the consumer is healthy, **Amazon.com, Inc.  **(NASDAQ:AMZN) said its Prime Day went well. (See more on that below.) And several banks that reported this week, including **Bank of America Corp** (NYSE:BAC), have been seeing strong consumer demand.\n\nMeanwhile, **United Continental** (NASDAQ:UAL) beat expectations on both earnings and revenue, and the company raising guidance. That presented a bright spot for transportation, as UAL finished in the green while the Dow Jones Transportation Average dropped nearly 3.6%.\n\nCrude oil prices were modestly bouncing back this morning after having a rough week, up about 0.7% at near $57.15 per barrel after Iran seized an oil tanker it believed was smuggling crude. The sudden increase lifts prices from two-week lows, as prices sagged in part because U.S. crude supplies fell recently, but by less than expected. Crude stockpiles were down about 3.1 million barrels for last week, when third-party analysts expected them to fall by 4.2 million barrels.\n\n  \n**FIGURE 1: DERAILED?** The Dow Jones Transportation Average ($DJT - candlestick) went off the rails Wednesday. The closely watched index, which includes rail, trucking, and air transport companies, was led lower by CSX after the company reported earnings and revenue that fell short of Wall Street expectations. Note that throughout the spring and summer rally, transports have lagged the Dow Jones Industrial Average ($DJI - purple line).  Data Source: S&P Dow Jones Indices.

Past performance does not guarantee future results._  \n\n**Lifeblood of the Economy** : Transportation companies are considered bellwethers for the economy. Trucks and planes haul the goods we buy and need delivered. Airlines\' fortunes rise and fall with how many trips consumers and business people take, which can be linked to the apparent health of the economy. So it can be concerning when the chief executive of a major rail company publicly scratches his head about the state of the economy even as his company misses on quarterly financial expectations and cuts its sales outlook. "Both global and U.S. economic conditions have been unusual this year, to say the least, and have impacted our volumes," CSX CEO James Foote said. "The present economic backdrop is one of the most puzzling I have experienced in my career." Another CSX executive added that resolution or clarity on the tariff situation would be helpful but is beyond the company\'s control. \n\n**Healthy Consumer** : Despite misgivings on Wall Street about earnings season and the continued trade situation with China, consumers seem to be doing OK, at least as measured by shopping via Amazon. "This year, Prime Day was once again the largest shopping event in Amazon history with more than one million deals exclusively for Prime members," the internet retailing giant said Wednesday. "Over the two days of Prime Day, on July 15 and 16, sales surpassed the previous Black Friday and Cyber Monday combined." The company said that Prime members bought more than 175 million items during the event and purchased more than $2 billion worth of products from independent third-party sellers, which are mostly small and medium-sized businesses. The news from Amazon comes after U.S. retail sales data came in stronger than expected for the June period. \n\n**Foreign Housing Investment** : One of the big worries about the ongoing tariff situation is how it might weigh on global growth. News from the housing market on Wednesday wasn\'t encouraging. The National Association of Realtors said that foreign buyers bought 36% less of U.S. existing homes from April 2018 to March 2019 in dollar terms compared with the previous period. "A confluence of many factors--slower economic growth abroad, tighter capital controls in China, a stronger U.S. dollar and a low inventory of homes for sale--contributed to the pullback of foreign buyers," the association said. "However, the magnitude of the decline is quite striking, implying less confidence in owning a property in the U.S."\n\n_Information from TDA is not intended to be investment advice or construed as a recommendation or endorsement of any particular investment or investment strategy, and is for illustrative purposes only.

Prompted by the passage of the 2018 Farm Bill, which legalized hemp and hemp derivatives like CBD, investors and entrepreneurs have been scrambling to capitalize on the increasingly popular substance. The United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has tried its regulatory best to pump the breaks on the phenomenon by asserting its authority and cracking down on illicit sales of CBD supplements.\n\nStanding on the sidelines are large-scale national retailers, many of which understand the potential profits but prefer not to pique the ire of federal authorities. While some retailers are staying out of the CBD craze completely, others are splitting the difference by offering topical CBD products, which are less likely to draw the legal wrath of the FDA.\n\nIn March, **CVS Health Corp  **(NYSE:CVS) and **Walgreens**(NASDAQ:WBA) became the first national retailers to announce that they were peddling CBD creams, patches, and sprays in their stores. CVS was selling them in eight states (Alabama, California, Colorado, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Maryland, and Tennessee), while Walgreens marketed them in nine (Colorado, Kentucky, Illinois, Indiana, New Mexico, Oregon, South Carolina, Tennessee, and Vermont).\n\nFollowing suit, Kroger -- the nation\'s largest grocery chain -- announced last month its plans to sell CBD products in 945 stores in 17 U.S. states (Arizona, Arkansas, Colorado, Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Michigan, Missouri, Nevada, Oregon, South Carolina, Tennessee, West Virginia, Washington, Wisconsin and Wyoming).\n\nBoth chains were deliberate in noting that their offerings would be limited to topicals, while stopping short of any foods, beverages, or dietary supplements as the FDA determines its policies for oversight and quality assurances.\n\nFor now, corporate retailers\' selling CBD-infused beauty and skin-care products brings far less legal jeopardy and exposure to liability, which explains their choices in stocking such types of products first. The FDA is tolerating topicals and oils containing CBD, so long as marketers refrain from making exaggerated health claims. Meantime, the FDA is considering any avenues by which companies could add CBD to food and dietary supplements. The agency closed its period for public comment this week, and Dr. Amy Abernethy, FDA\'s principal deputy commissioner and acting CIO, pledged to provide guidance by the early fall.\n\nMeantime, pharmacies and grocery stores are not the only retail players in the market. Last year, the cosmetics chain Sephora began involving itself with CBD topicals when it started selling a high-CBD body lotion made by the luxury brand Lord Jones through its online shop. Now the company is offering a variety of CBD lotions and body oils in 171 of its retail stores nationwide. Not to be left out, the luxury retailer Neiman Marcus is also offering CBD topicals as well.\n\nThe cannabis company Green Growth Brands has likewise made some major in-roads with national retailers. Recently, the company signed with Brookfield Properties and Simon Property Group, two of the largest mall owners in the U.S., to sell branded topical CBD products. The company signed similar deals with Designer Shoe Warehouse and American Eagle.\n\nPerhaps the biggest adopter of CBD topicals yet is the organic grocery chain Whole Foods: With little fanfare, the company has begun selling CBD products throughout its stores, a practice made all the more significant given that Whole Foods is owned by **Amazon****.com, Inc**. (NASDAQ:AMZN).\n\nShould the retail momentum behind such large national retailers be aided by favorable treatment from the FDA, CBD products will truly have made a game-changing impact beyond the countertop of the local gas station.\n\n* * *\n\n### **William Sumner**\n\nWilliam Sumner is a writer for the hemp and cannabis industry.

 '**Amazon.com, Inc.** (NASDAQ:AMZN) announced today it will open two more fulfillment centers in Ohio, which will bring to 10 the number of locations that the e-tailer operates in the state.\n\nThe centers, which will be built in Akron and Rossford, will each measure 700,000 square feet and will be used to pick, pack and ship small items like electronics, books and toys, Amazon said. The Akron center is expected to open in the fourth quarter of 2019, and the Rossford location is scheduled to open in the fourth quarter of 2020, according to MWPVL International, Inc., a consultancy that tracks Amazon\'s fulfillment and distribution activity.\n\nThe Rossford center is expected to employ about 1,000, according to MWPVL projections. The consultancy did not have projected staffing numbers for the Akron center. \n\nRossford is located near Toledo, at the intersection of I-75 and the Ohio Turnpike, which is signed as Interstates 76, 80 and 90. Akron is about 40 miles from Cleveland.\n\nAmazon has 407 facilities of different types throughout the U.S. and an additional 59 planned for construction.\n\nImage Sourced by Pixabay\n\n_FreightWaves features Market Voices - a forum for those with unique knowledge of numerous transportation/logistics/supply chain sectors, as well as other critical expertise._\n\nAirports are funded by a mix of public and private money. As an example, airlines pay landing fees for flights and passengers have a number of facility and security surcharges added to their tickets. Combined with other revenue sources like bond sales and federal funding allocated by Congressional appropriations, airports are constantly striving to secure as much funding possible for a variety of projects and expenses.\n\nEarlier this month, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) released a detailed list of the airports that will receive funds under the agency\'s annual Airport Improvement Plan (AIP) grant program. According to the FAA, "For large and medium primary hub airports, the grant covers 75 percent of eligible costs (or 80 percent for noise program implementation). For small primary, reliever and general aviation airports, the grant covers a range of 90-95 percent of eligible costs, based on statutory requirements."\n\nThe list of grant awards runs nearly 30, single-spaced landscape pages of spreadsheet output. A number of airports have a heavy air cargo focus and these grants provide additional dollars to complete projects ranging from taxiway improvements to runway reconstructions that allow both passenger and freighter aircraft to more quickly and efficiently arrive, load, unload and depart.\n\nChicago\'s Rockford International Airport (RFD), approximately 90 miles northwest of O\'Hare International Airport, is home to **Amazon.com Inc.** \'s (NASDAQ:AMZN) Prime Air, **UPS Inc.  **(NYSE:UPS) and operates a robust aircraft maintenance facility. RFD is slated to receive almost $11.3 million to rehabilitate a runway and taxiway. Given the increasing number of takeoffs and landings, the airport\'s goal is to ensure that its infrastructure can handle the additional traffic that has grown over the past several years.\n\nO\'Hare will receive a grant of $65 million that will be put towards the construction of runway 10C/28C - the final runway in the airport\'s modernization plan that has seen new runways constructed, additional cargo handling facilities added and will be looking towards new passenger terminals over the next decade.\n\nFrom the airlines\' perspective, while the awarding of grants doesn\'t directly impact them, the obvious investment that an airport makes, coupled with its natural geography, are a few of the key factors that are considered when selecting destinations. For airports with a focus on freighters, the pool of carriers is different and the competition fierce.\n\nNorth American Director of Sales for AirBridge Cargo, Caroline Pappas, knows the importance of infrastructure. "As an operator of only freighter aircraft, being close to our \'customer\' means looking at where we have cargo coming from and going to. While connectivity for passengers isn\'t important, connectivity for cargo is," Pappas offered.\n\n"Access to interstate highway systems and the ability to quickly load and unload our aircraft are key considerations for AirBridge. When airports AirBridge uses like O\'Hare and Rickenbacker are continually making infrastructure investments that support air cargo, it reinforces our choice to make them key hubs for our activities."\n\nWithout passengers needing to arrive or depart a proximal destination for leisure or business, cargo airports are focused on the freighters that arrive and depart and have cargo terminating within the arriving market or have ready, multi-modal access to population centers that are within one to two days driving distance.\n\nBut you don\'t have to be a freighter operator to focus on cargo. For Southwest Airlines and the robust business that Southwest Cargo does within its network, the airline flies to many of the airports that received AIP grants this month.\n\n"From a [Southwest] Cargo standpoint, we look at the AIP grants through the same lens and with the same question - how do we provide the best service to our customers at the lowest cost," shared Wally Devereaux, Managing Director of Cargo and Charters. "We value our airport partnerships and work in concert with our airport partners during projects to ensure there is little impact to our customers, employees and overall operations, including ensuring cargo gets to the places it needs to go."\n\nDallas, Texas is home to both Southwest Airlines and American Airlines. Dallas Fort Worth International Airport (DFW) and Alliance Airports both were grant recipients.\n\n"DFW is currently utilizing the $23 million AIP grant from the FAA for future taxiway rehabilitation. It\'s part of a 10-year-infrastructure renewal plan to rehabilitate runways, taxiways and more than 1,000 miles of roadways and bridges on airport property," says Milton De La Paz, DFW\'s Vice President of Airline Relations. "Those improvements will directly benefit our cargo partners, enhancing safety, security and operational efficiency, while also building DFW Airport\'s reputation as a premier cargo hub."\n\nWith airlines and airports competing for passengers and new city pairings that more fuel-efficient aircraft offer, the available belly space for cargo will increase and for airports catering to freighter aircraft, their cases are bolstered for why they should see more traffic as well.\n\nImage sourced from Google\n\n**Amazon.com, Inc.** (NASDAQ:AMZN)\'s exit from the food delivery business "doesn\'t change anything" for industry titan **GrubHub Inc** (NYSE:GRUB), according to CNBC\'s Jim Cramer.\n\n### What Happened\n\nGrubHub\'s competitive positioning appears to have eased with Amazon\'s exit from the food delivery business -- but the competitive landscape is still "relentless," Cramer said during his daily "Mad Money" show Friday.\n\nAmazon\'s decision to leave the market could be seen not as a sign it "gave up," but rather as an "indictment of the whole industry."\n\nOn its end, GrubHub continues to spend "money like crazy" just to defend its market share, Cramer said.\n\nThe company hasn\'t seen much success and its margins have come under "serious pressure," he said.\n\nAnd if GrubHub hasn\'t faced enough headwinds, there could be a new one as the New York State Liquor Authority presents new rules and regulations on how the company charges restaurants, Cramer said. \n\n### Why It\'s Important\n\nSome of the defining characteristics of the space are a lack of differentiation and loyalty, the CNBC host said.\n\nAmazon may have recognized the realities of the competitive landscape, and if it is too difficult for Amazon to crack, Cramer questioned how it will be possible for GrubHub to succeed.  \n\n### What\'s Next\n\nEven if the food delivery business as a whole can show signs of booming, at the end of the day there is "no real good way" to invest in it, Cramer said.\n\nThe same logic holds true today as it did in February when Cramer said to "run" from GrubHub and all of its competitors, he said Friday. \n\nAmazon shares were trading higher by 0.92% at $1,981.82 at the time of publication Monday, while GrubHub shares were down 1.86% at $73.96. \n\n_Related Links:_\n\n_Benchmark Says GrubHub Will Be A Winner In The Food Delivery Space_\n\n_GrubHub Shares Lower As New York State Authority Could Curb Delivery Fees_\n\n_Photo courtesy of GrubHub.  _\n\nIn a new report from the FreightWaves Freight Intel Group - "Why Truck Failures Could Increase in 2019," - the authors have found that trucking company failures are usually the result of unexpected large spikes in diesel prices that then cannot be adequately passed on via fuel surcharges by small to midsize carriers.\n\n_FreightWaves SONAR:_  \n**Total U.S. Trucking Failures**\n\nIn the report the FreightWaves Freight Intel Group outlines three factors that may portend an increase in truck failures in the near future.\n\nFirst, spot rates are down meaningfully - 20 percent year-over-year and 30 percent off of their peak. Second, contract rates are moving lower (and are at risk of downward revisions going forward). Third, trucking companies\' costs are running higher due to wage increases and excess capacity entering the market following a robust 2018. Third, there is a very real potential for higher diesel prices because of the implementation of IMO 2020. \n\nBecause of these factors, staff members of the FreightWaves Freight Intel Group believe the first meaningful increase in trucking company failures in years could occur in 2019. \n\nTrucking company failures have been quite low both on an absolute and relative basis over the past several years (outside of a small increase in 2013-2014). In fact, trucking company failures reached an all-time low in 2018 across the 30 years of data FreightWaves staff analyzed going back to 1990. It has been 11 years since the trucking market has seen a really significant bout of failures.\n\n"Why Truck Failures Could Increase in 2019" is available to FreightWaves SONAR subscribers. In the report, FreightWaves staff and Michigan State University professor Jason Miller examined nearly 30 years of truck failure data through a regression analysis to eliminate the noise and determine which factors are statistically significant indicators of truck failures. \n\n_FreightWaves SONAR:_  \n**Total Quarterly U.S. Trucking Failures vs. Year-Over-Year Change in Failures**\n\nThey concluded that just three factors were particularly significant drivers: the number of trucking company failures in the prior quarter; the natural logarithm of diesel prices; and the natural logarithm of the producer price index (PPI) for long-haul trucking. Diesel prices and the truckload PPI are equally important factors.\n\nTrucking company failures are a good barometer for general trucking market and economic health. Increasing numbers of failures indicate a weakening climate for trucking while low or decreasing values indicate a stable environment.\n\n**What Are the Leading Causes of Trucking Failures?  **\n\nWhen contemplating the leading causes for trucking failures, the principal qualitative reasons often cited by the failing companies and the media include the following (which are not mutually exclusive and often co-dependent):\n\n  * Recessions\n  * Falling contract and spot prices\n  * Rising diesel prices\n  * Expensive, rising and unaffordable insurance costs\n  * High labor and maintenance costs\n  * Unionized labor forces\n  * Onerous contracts with large shippers ([e.g. **Amazon.com, NASDAQ:AMZN)]\n\n\n\nAll make a great deal of sense on the surface and likely do play some part in most failures. However, the single most predictive variable was the number of failures in the quarter before. Failures tend to cluster, spike episodically and persist for a number of quarters when conditions in the industry deteriorate.\n\nThe next predictive variable was the year-over-year change in the natural logarithm of diesel prices. The natural logarithm is used because it translates into percentage changes. The easiest way to describe why the natural logarithm is the superior measure is that a $0.20 increase in the price of diesel today (with average diesel prices of $3 per gallon) is not equivalent to a $0.20 increase back in the 1990s when the average price per gallon was hovering around $1. \n\n_FreightWaves SONAR:_  \n**Year-Over-Year Change in Trucking Failures**  \nvs. % Change in Contract Rates and Diesel\n\nEqually as predictive of the change in trucking failures is the year-over-year change in the natural logarithm of the truckload PPI. The PPI data primarily captures truckload carriers\' contract rates, given the vast majority of truckload (TL) freight moves under contract. Contract rates are used because carriers with greater than five trucks normally source two-thirds to three-fourths of their business from the contract market. Contract rates are not nearly as volatile as spot rates for trucking. In the study, the year-over-year changes in contract rates varied between a 10 percent increase in boom times (2018) and a 10 percent decrease in dreadful times (2009). \n\nLastly, there is a high correlation (0.73) between diesel prices and contract rates because as diesel prices move higher, they get passed on as fuel surcharges (at least by mid-size and large-size carriers). The failure data shows that these fuel surcharges sometimes simply are not enough and do not fully pass on the diesel cost increases. \n\n_FreightWaves SONAR:_  \n**Sensitivity Analysis: Change in Trucking Failures vs. % Change in Contract Rates and Average Retail Diesel Price per Gallon**\n\nThe biggest surprise to most outside of trucking industry professionals would be that failures are not primarily caused by spot and contract rates falling steeply in a recession. Instead, failures are primarily due to huge spikes in diesel prices that smaller carriers cannot pass on.\n\nThe failure model as constructed by Michigan State University (MSU) Professor Jason Miller and FreightWaves is not intended to be utilized primarily as a forecasting tool. Rather, it is designed to try and explain what factors account for the time-series variance in trucking failures. That being said, we would expect a significant pick-up in failures due to the confluence of several negative factors: the lagged effect of extremely down spot prices will begin to filter through to lower contract rates; IMO 2020 should keep diesel prices at least flat (and potentially cause materially higher diesel prices in our view); and labor/operational costs should remain high as many trucking companies increased driver pay that will not be clawed back. This dual revenue and cost pressure is likely to cause a meaningful increase in failures.\n\nA final negative factor that is likely to come into play and cause increasing failures throughout 2019 is excess capacity, with outbound tender rejections (OTRI.USA) at 12-month lows. Tender rejections are a measure of carrier optionality and with much more capacity in the market competing for lower freight volumes (OTVIY.USA), which are down 7.6 percent year-over-year, carriers are experiencing downward rate pressure exacerbating their increasing lack of viability.\n\nWith record levels of Class 8 new truck orders in 2018 and delivery dates well into this summer, a large number of trucks will be hitting the market just as demand begins softening and lapping hard comparisons from the prior year. This type of environment characterized by growing excess capacity is highly conducive to growing truck failures.\n\nThe authors of the report expect a significant pick-up in trucking company failures due to the confluence of several negative factors: the lagged effect of extremely down spot prices will begin to filter through to lower contract rates; IMO 2020 should keep diesel prices at least flat (and potentially cause materially higher diesel prices); and labor/operational costs should remain high as many trucking companies increased driver pay.

Analysts are expecting the e-commerce and cloud computing juggernaut to report a profit of $5.29 per share, up from $5.07 a year earlier. Shares of Amazon account for more than 23% of the Consumer Discretionary Select Sector Index.\n\nDow component **McDonald \'s Corp. **(NYSE:MCD), another bellwether among consumer cyclical names, reports on July 26. McDonald\'s is expected to report a quarterly profit of $2.06 a share, up from $1.99 a share a year earlier. The stock is the third-largest component in the Consumer Discretionary Select Sector Index at over 7%.\n\nThe combined market value of the consumer discretionary sector in the U.S. currently resides at $5.46 trillion with Amazon commanding $975 billion of that total.\n\n### **What \'s Next**\n\nWANT and PASS are still less than a year old, meaning they are somewhat new on the leveraged sector ETF scene, but the funds are credible options for active traders lacking the capital to put on decent-sized positions in Amazon.\n\nPlus, there are inklings some traders are starting to pay more attention to the leveraged consumer cyclical funds. For the five days ending July 18, volume in the bullish WANT was more than 58% above the trailing 20-day average, according to Direxion data.\n\n_Related Links_\n\n_Getting Bearish On Regional Bank ETFs_\n\n_Pet Care ETF Pushes Higher _\n\nIf the entire earnings season got stuffed into one day, we\'d be just about done with breakfast. \n\nIt\'s been a nutritious one, with 79% of reporting companies coming in above expectations so far, according to FactSet. Still, lunch and dinner have to be served, and this week features about 25% of all S&P 500 companies sharing results. Things got off to a mixed start with energy firm **Halliburton Company  **(NYSE:HAL) reporting earnings per share that beat expectations but coming up short on revenue.\n\nEarnings are roughly 15% finished, and optimism is starting to build that maybe things can turn out a little better than the goose egg many people had expected. That could help explain why stocks have a positive tone this morning. By the end of this Friday, 40% of earnings will be done, and we\'ll have to wait and see what the tone is like by then.\n\nSomething else to consider keeping an eye on this week is the situation in Washington, D.C. The House is set to go on recess after Friday, and there\'s still no budget deal. If that doesn\'t get straightened out, worries could build about a possible government shutdown and the debt ceiling, which the Treasury secretary said last week needs to be raised.\n\nOne more thing to keep in mind as the week moves along is the European Central Bank (ECB), which has a rate decision scheduled for Thursday. An interest rate cut might be in the cards, analysts said, or at least some sort of new stimulus.\n\n### Iran Worries Still Simmering\n\nLast week sputtered to a close as geopolitics sailed back into the picture. News at midday Friday that Iran seized a British tanker appeared to stir up some waves, and the S&P 500 Index (SPX) sank back after its early gains. The tanker situation hasn\'t been resolved as of Monday morning, and that might be part of what\'s giving crude a 2% boost. There\'s growing concern about potential supply disruptions to the energy-rich Persian Gulf.\n\nGoing back to Friday, it looked like one of those times when the market\'s been up a lot recently and people decided to take some risk off the table going into the weekend. What\'s interesting is how crude only rose about $1 on the Iran news and volatility didn\'t get much of a lift, at least initially. However, the Cboe Volatility Index (VIX)--the most closely watched "fear indicator"--did begin to climb more as Friday\'s session advanced, finishing above 14. It had spent much of last week below 13. \n\nThe tension with Iran is a reminder that outside events continue to play a role, and that goes beyond the obvious trade battle with China. U.S. stocks are arguably priced for perfection up here near all-time highs as investors anticipate a rate cut by the end of this month. However, a shaky first week of earnings, growing Brexit concerns, and a debt limit battle shaping up in Congress all could stand in the way of continued gains. So could any bad news on the China trade front or if the tensions with Iran get worse.\n\n### Miss on Earnings? Get Punished\n\nWith the first full week of earnings season behind us, the prediction made before earnings started appears to hold true for reporting companies: If you beat, you may be mildly rewarded, but if you miss, you are likely to get pounded. It\'s the biggest overall trend, and we saw it with **Netflix, Inc.  **(NASDAQ:NFLX) and **CSX Corporation  **(NASDAQ:CSX) both taking a beating when they came up short, and **Microsoft Corporation  **(NASDAQ:MSFT) and some of the bank stocks only getting slight lifts when they surpassed expectations.\n\nLast week\'s batch of corporate earnings also appeared to show that consumers are spending money, but companies have a wide range of potential problems heading into the second half of the year. Industrial companies are likely to continue dealing with the impact of the U.S.-China trade war, and the market\'s collective eye could also be focused on slowing growth for some key manufacturing data all around the world. Some of this could show up in earnings.\n\nThis week, investors are likely to focus on projections from chipmakers and what social media company executives have to say about the impact of government inquiries into privacy issues. Some of the key companies reporting this week include Boeing (BA), Lockheed Martin (LMT), **Tesla Inc  **(NASDAQ:TSLA), **Alphabet Inc  **(NASDAQ:GOOG), **Facebook, Inc.  **(NASDAQ:FB), **Amazon.com, Inc.  **(NASDAQ:AMZN), **Intel Corporation  **(NASDAQ:INTC), **Ford Motor Company  **(NYSE:F), **AT &T Inc **(NYSE:T), and **Twitter Inc  **(NYSE:TWTR).\n\n### Silence is Golden This Week at the Fed\n\nThough earnings pick up later this week, Fed speakers go into a short hibernation as the silent period begins ahead of next week\'s Federal Open Market Committee meeting. There was a lot of scuttlebutt late last week after New York Fed President John Williams appeared to hint at a half-point rate cut, but that anticipation kind of dwindled Friday when the New York Fed walked back those comments, saying they were "academic" and not necessarily related to the meeting ahead.\n\nThe new week begins with CME Group futures showing investors firmly in the camp of expecting just a 25-basis point cut, with approximately 75% odds of that. Falling hopes for a 50-point cut might also have weighed on stocks toward the end of Friday\'s session. A 75% chance doesn\'t guarantee a 25-point cut, but typically a percentage this high so close to a meeting has proven correct in the past.\n\nLooking at the data picture, existing and new home sales for June both come out early this week, but things get more exciting Friday when the government delivers its first estimate for U.S. Q2 gross domestic product (GDP) growth. At this point, analysts look for growth of just 1.8%, according to a consensus estimate from Briefing.com. That\'s down from 3.1% in Q1, and would be the lowest quarterly GDP growth since Q1 of 2017. \n\nAs economic growth slows, U.S. Treasury yields just can\'t get it going. The 10-year yield finished the old week under 2.06% after climbing above 2.1% a few days earlier. These geopolitical tensions wouldn\'t seem likely to help yields much, as situations like this often send investors fleeing into what they see as "defensive" investments like Treasuries (yields move in the opposite direction of the underlying Treasury note).\n\nHowever, if investors were feeling cautious Friday, they didn\'t show it through their choice of sectors. The so-called "defensive" sectors like Real Estate and Utilities were some of the worst performers of the day, while Industrials and Energy were among the few to rise.\n\nOn the plus side, transport stocks kept gaining Friday as another solid earnings report came in, this time from **KC Southern** (NYSE:KSU). That followed strong **Union Pacific Corporation**  (NYSE:UNP) results earlier in the week and raised hopes that trains and trucks remain full of goods, which can signal healthy economic demand. An earnings beat from American Express (AXP) late last week fell into the same category. The latest University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment report out Friday for early July rose from June.\n\n  \n**Figure 1:  STOCKS AND GOLD IN SYNC**: Stocks (SPX - candlestick) and gold (/GC - purple line) spent parts of last week moving together, with both reaching significant highs recently. The Federal Reserve is expected to cut interest rates, which could be favorable for gold and stock prices, which don\'t always rally together. Data Source: S&P Dow Jones Indices, CME Group. Chart source: The thinkorswim® platform from TD Ameritrade. _For illustrative purposes only. Past performance does not guarantee future results._\n\n**Political Tensions Could Help Gold** : The S&P 500 index (SPX) hit an all-time high last week but mixed earnings reports and political tensions toward the end of the week may have contributed to the index pulling back by Friday. Gold, which has been rallying this year, also hit a significant high last week, with the shiny metal trading above its six-year high of $1,400 per ounce. Seeing stocks and gold trade in sync (see Figure 1 above) isn\'t unusual in a low interest rate environment, and as we head towards the next Fed meeting, it might be a good idea for investors to keep an eye on both these markets. Will easier monetary policy continue to favor stocks and gold, or one over the other? \n\n**Home Builders Hitting Snags?** In general, homebuilder stocks have had a fairly strong year, with most companies up so far in tandem with the broader market. While the housing market has made substantial strides since it crashed a decade ago, progress has been slow. Both housing starts and building permits for declined in June for the second straight month. Builders are grappling with a tight labor market and a shortage of land on which to build, which has made it hard for them to keep up with the high demand. Tighter supplies usually leads to higher prices, so potential buyers may be shut out, even as borrowing costs remain fairly low.\n\n**NVR, Inc**. (NYSE:NVR)--up 45% year to date and one of the largest homebuilders in the U.S.--reported quarterly results Friday that beat revenue and earnings expectations. The company\'s new home orders increased 6%, but the average price of those homes declined, showing the market may be favoring less expensive homes over luxury homes lately. Next up for signs of how homebuilders are faring, consider watching for **PulteGroup, Inc.  **(NYSE:PHM) earnings before the opening bell tomorrow.\n\n**Bad News? No Problem** : For anyone astonished to see **Boeing Co** \'s****(NYSE:BA) shares rise in post-market trading Thursday immediately after the company announced a nearly $5 billion charge due to its troubled 737-MAX program, it provided a good example of a common occurrence in the market that might be worth remembering. While BA\'s news was bad, it also wiped its slate clean in some ways. How big a charge the company would take was a major question going into the company\'s earnings later this week, and the question got answered ahead of time. It wasn\'t good news, but some analysts wrote in notes Friday that it could have been worse, and they also pointed out that BA intends to get the plane back into the air in Q4, earlier than some had expected. \n\nAs one analyst pointed out on CNBC, you don\'t even have to go too far back to find the last time a relief rally occurred for a stock in the case of bad news people had expected. Facebook (FB) shares rose earlier this month after FB got fined $5 billion by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) for its privacy practices. Does all this mean bad news is good? Not exactly, but maybe when it comes to companies facing trouble, the lesson is to hope for the best but prepare for the worst.\n\n_Information from TDA is not intended to be investment advice or construed as a recommendation or endorsement of any particular investment or investment strategy, and is for illustrative purposes only.

But that could be a reality soon.\n\n**TD Ameritrade** (NASDAQ:AMTD) announced Monday several new integrations that will provide access to real-time quotes, portfolio information, and content from the TDA Network via**Apple Inc** (NASDAQ:AAPL) CarPlay, **Alphabet Inc \'s **(NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Android Auto and **Amazon.com Inc \'s** (NASDAQ:AMZN) Echo Auto.\n\nThe move to vehicles marks the latest technological frontier for the retail brokerage, which has also developed chatbots for social media, text-to-trade functionality for Apple Business Chat and voice-activated trading through Alexa.\n\n### **What To Know**\n\n"You\'ve got us on your desktop; you\'ve got us on our mobile app; you\'ve got us through messaging platforms like Facebook and Apple Business Chat; you\'ve got us through your in-home speakers with Alexa; and now you\'ve also got us on the go in your car where, whether we like it or not, as Americans we spend a great deal of quality time," Sunayna Tuteja, TD Ameritrade\'s head of strategic partnerships and emerging technologies, told Benzinga.\n\nA survey from the AAA Foundation found that U.S. drivers spend an average of 51 minutes per day behind the wheel, a 6% increase from 2014.\n\nThe integration with Android Auto and Echo Auto will allow drivers to use voice commands to see how their portfolio is doing, get market performance updates, real-time quotes of individual stocks, and news from TD Ameritrade Network.

 'The big tech companies that dominate internet search, online shopping and social media will come under more scrutiny with the Justice Department reportedly broadening a government investigation into the sector.\n\n### What Happened\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reported Tuesday afternoon that the Department of Justice will examine the industry to determine whether the big tech companies are illegally stifling competition. Among the companies likely to be part of the agency\'s probe are **Facebook Inc**. (NASDAQ:FB), **Amazon.com Inc**. (NASDAQ:AMZN), **Apple Inc**. (NASDAQ:AAPL) and **Alphabet Inc**(NASDAQ:GOOGL)\'s Google.\n\n### What It Means\n\nThe companies already face extensive regulatory interest and the Journal reported the DOJ review would go beyond already-known looks by the DOJ and the Federal Trade Commission into the sector\'s business practices. The new review could mean some companies could face antitrust investigations from both the Justice Department and the FTC, which earlier this year created a task force to study competition in the industry.\n\nIn addition to the growth and size of the companies, the agency has expressed interest in how the companies might take advantage of the data created by their large user networks, the report said.\n\n### Price Action\n\nShares of Apple, Facebook, Amazon.com and Google were all trading down in the after-hours session with Facebook seeing the biggest drop, down 1.66%.\n\n_Related Links:_\n\n_Facebook, FTC To Settle Privacy Charges For $5B_\n\n_Alphabet\'s Google Braces For Antitrust Investigation From The Justice Department_\n\nChinese business-to-business e-commerce giant **Alibaba Group** (NYSE:BABA) said Tuesday that it will make its platform, Alibaba.com, available to U.S.-based sellers, a dramatic step with competitive ramifications for all players in the domestic e-commerce supply chain.\n\nThe new channel will be marketed to U.S.-based manufacturers, wholesalers and distributors, and will involve a "new network of industry partners" such as "anchor sellers," Alibaba said. Among them is Robinson Fresh, the produce unit of broker and third-party logistics provider **C.H. Robinson Worldwide Inc**. (NASDAQ:CHRW), which launched a store on the site on Tuesday. Another is office supply firm Office Depot, Inc.\n\nThe launch will be accompanied by a nationwide U.S. tour to meet with business owners and explain the site\'s nuances and benefits, Alibaba said. The first event was held today in Brooklyn, New York, with events in Los Angeles and Chicago scheduled for the coming week. Online payment systems were launched today as well, though they are not currently available to sellers in New York and Nevada, Alibaba said.\n\nThe platform\'s focus, Alibaba said, will be on the 30 million U.S. small to mid-sized business (SMB) owners. Alibaba will teach them how to source and sell on the site. The SMB market is especially coveted as these businesses typically lack the in-house resources and expertise to sell globally, and can command higher margins than their much-larger counterparts. **FedEx Corp.** , (NYSE:FDX) **UPS Inc.**(NYSE:UPS) and DHL Express, a unit of German giant Deutsche Post DHL, are aggressively courting the SMB segment. **Amazon.com, Inc.** \'s (NASDAQ:AMZN) bread-and-butter customers increasingly are third-party merchants, most of them smaller companies, who use Amazon\'s fulfillment and delivery services.\n\nUntil now, Alibaba\'s services were available in the U.S. only to buyers of goods from China. However, it was thought that it was a matter of when, not if, Alibaba would open its platform to U.S. sellers.\n\nAlibaba estimates the global B2B e-commerce market to be nearly $24 billion. According to a recent study by Forrester Research, B2B e-commerce sales in the United States hit $1.134 trillion in 2018,  equal to about 12 percent of the $9 trillion in total B2B U.S. spending last year.\n\nFounded in 1999, Alibaba reaches 190 countries with a network of 150,000 sellers and 10 million buyers. According to Brittain Ladd, a former Amazon executive and an e-commerce consultant, Alibaba has the track record in retail and logistics expertise to cut a wide swath of disruption through the B2B market in the U.S. and its labyrinth of retailers and delivery companies. "Alibaba has a significant opportunity to become the anti-Amazon and anti-Walmart," Ladd said in a Linkedin post. "In addition, Alibaba has the potential to leverage its platform and logistics prowess to help companies avoid using established players like FedEx and UPS."\n\nLadd has said that Alibaba should buy a U.S. retailer to fully establish its U.S. presence, but that it would fall to President Trump to approve such a deal if one does occur.\n\nIn 2013, Alibaba, along with eight other companies, founded Cainiao Logistics. It is the logistics unit of Alibaba.\n\nImage sourced from Pixabay\n\nToward the end of trading Tuesday, the Dow traded up 0.59% to 27331.43 while the NASDAQ rose 0.37% to 8234.15.

The reality is outside of California, few people cared about Carmageddon in 2011, but those that moved freight certainly did. The original Carmageddon closed portions of I-405 for 55 hours as the California Department of Transportation (CALTRANS) conducted repairs along that stretch of highway.\n\nNow it\'s back, and some are saying this version will be much worse than what occurred in 2011. CALTRANS has started the $134-million project, which will replace pavement slabs along SR 60, upgrade ADA access points and repave on- and off-ramps from Euclid Avenue in Ontario to the 60/91/215 junction in Riverside. Bridge structures along the route will also be replaced. The project is expected to be completed in fall 2021, weather permitting.\n\nTo accommodate the work, the state is shutting down State Route 60 weeknights in Ontario between 10 p.m. and 5 a.m. through mid-November. Dubbed SR-60 SWARM, the project will also include these weekend closures:\n\n  * Full closure of eastbound SR 60, including all eastbound on and off ramps, between I-15 and the 60/91/215 Junction in Riverside for eight weekends from Friday nights at 10 p.m. to Monday mornings at 5 a.m. from July 26 through September 23 (excluding Labor Day weekend). There will be no eastbound access during this closure. Motorists may use the westbound SR 60 to access local on and off ramps.\n  * Full closure of westbound SR 60, including all westbound on and off ramps, between the 60/91/215 Junction in Riverside to I-15 for seven weekends from Friday nights at 10:00 p.m. to Monday mornings at 5 a.m. from September 28 through November 18 (excluding Veteran\'s Day). There will be no westbound access during this closure. Motorists may use the eastbound SR 60 to access local on and off ramps.\n\n\n\nCALTRANS is advising motorists to find alternate routes, when possible, such as using as I-10, I-15, SR-210 and SR-91 to avoid the closure and delays. Access to local areas and businesses will be available by accessing on and off ramps from the opposite direction of the closure.\n\nThe project began on July 22, 2019. The state has set up a 60 SWARM hotline for more information at 1-833-607-9276.\n\n## Did you know?\n\n**Amazon.com, Inc**.

(The Edge Markets)\n\n## Final Thoughts\n\nOntario, California, is one of the most heavily truck-traveled areas in the country as it serves as a prime warehouse area for freight moving into and out of the Ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach. For the next several months, freight companies will need to pay attention to their routing as the state\'s Department of Transportation has begun a massive $134 million road project that will include replacing pavement and bridges along State Route 60 between Ontario and Riverside. Road closures will take place in the evening, after 10:00 p.m., and on weekends, but some in the state are saying the traffic disruption could be worse than the infamous 2011 Carmageddon in the state when I-405 was closed for 55 hours. Fleet traffic managers and drivers need to be aware because even if they are not traveling SR-60, ancillary roads in the area will be filled with more traffic than normal.\n\nHammer down everyone!\n\nImage sourced from Pixabay\n\nFollowing the market opening Tuesday, the Dow traded up 0.30% to 27254.71 while the NASDAQ rose 0.16% to 8217.52.

Large traditional retailers such as **Walmart Inc  **(NYSE:WMT), **Target Corporation  **(NYSE:TGT) and **Best Buy Co Inc  **(NYSE:BBY) are getting in on the action with fast shipping and exclusive incentives for members. Further, these retailers and online-only competitors like eBay offered deals that overlapped with the Prime Day event in order to compete in the digital arena. Nonetheless, these traditional retailers will be playing catch up to gain any ground on Amazon and its 100 million-plus Prime members.\n\nConsumer spending moves the U.S. economy and accounts for nearly 70 percent of the gross domestic product (GDP). Within the consumer spending number, there is spending on goods and services. Spending on services makes up around 65 percent of all consumer purchases, with the goods portion accounting for the remaining 35 percent. Services contain sectors such as healthcare, education and other professional segments - in other words, sectors that don\'t move freight.\n\nOn the other hand, there are goods; items like vehicles, home furnishings, clothing and electronics - for the most part, retail items. These are the freight goods that are making their way across the country, primarily via truck or rail, every hour of the day. Retail spending serves as one of the key drivers of trucking demand in the economy, as most of the goods moving from warehouses to retail locations are transported via truckload or less-than-truckload (LTL) shipments.\n\nBut enough of the layers, what is the current state of the retail segment? \n\nFreightWaves SONAR: SONAR Ticker - RESL.DEPT, RESLONLN\n\nTraditional brick and mortar stores (RESL.DEPT) generally struggled to keep up with the pace of growth in e-commerce over the last few years. There was an unprecedented drop in growth for December 2018, but expansion has remained steady, outpacing department store growth. E-commerce growth is measured on a quarterly basis by the U.S. Census Bureau, but a sense for what is going on within the segment can be determined on a monthly basis by using electronic shopping and mail-order growth. Electronic shopping and mail-order (RESL.ONLN) are the classifications for businesses that are primarily e-commerce, so it covers what Amazon does but not capture online activity from traditional retailers. Nonetheless, electronic shopping and mail-order growth serve as a proxy for e-commerce and have grown progressively, about 10 to 14 percent over the last four years.\n\nFreightWaves SONAR: SONAR Ticker - RESLG.ONLN\n\nIt\'s not just traditional brick and mortar stores that have been outpaced by e-commerce, but most of the rest of the economy as well. There has not been a quarter of decline for e-commerce since the end of the recession. E-commerce growth has remained impressive through tax law changes, government shutdowns, trade tensions, currency fluctuations and a general slowdown in the manufacturing sector, often growing five to six times the speed of the rest of the economy. \n\n**Head of the pack**\n\nIt\'s no secret that Amazon is leading the charge when it comes to e-commerce. Amazon seems always to remain a step ahead of its traditional brick and mortar contemporaries - events like the two-day Prime Day event are a good example. Amazon debuted its new free one-day delivery service to Prime members with over 10 million items during the event. Amazon is constantly shortening its delivery window, one of the few remaining advantages that traditional department stores still have. Things aren\'t stopping with the one-day delivery service, with three million items now available for free same-day delivery for Prime members.\n\nA couple of purposes are being served with the Prime Day deals, first of which is you have to be a member to participate. Prime Day was a way for the e-commerce giant to expand its ever-growing membership. Second, Amazon is beginning to offer more and more of its own brand name items, with things like its Amazon Essentials, Echo devices, office items, clothing and health supplements. Amazon is not just a third-party online retailer, but a full-on retailer that offers its own items that can compete and out-price popular brands.\n\nAmazon is pulling off this new free one-day delivery service while growing less dependent on partnerships with delivery giants. FedEx recently decided not to renew its U.S. air contract with Amazon. However, Amazon broke ground in May on a new $1.5 billion air hub in Northern Kentucky. The center will have enough capacity to house around 100 planes.\n\nAdditionally, Amazon is moving closer and closer to being a fully self-sustainable organization that isn\'t reliant on any other companies to optimize its supply chain processes. It has a growing fleet of trucks and vans, and operates its own ocean freight services. There is also a rise in its independent contractor program called Amazon Flex. This program has local drivers pick up packages from warehouses and handle the most expensive aspect - final-mile delivery.\n\nAs of now, Amazon handles the shipment for 26 percent of its online orders, a number that is sure to rise in the coming years. However, with Amazon building out its own logistics fleet, it will be interesting to see what partnerships may form with major retailers and carriers or if any other company will be able to build out its own internal fleet to handle transportation.\n\n**Emerging trends**\n\nE-commerce seems to be the natural progression for businesses to remain competitive and be part of a sector that is outpacing other sectors of the overall economy. E-commerce serves as a shield that is invulnerable to protectionism and international trade conflicts (thus far). Parcel services such as FedEx, UPS and the U.S. Postal Service may have a more diminished role when it comes to partnering with Amazon, but surely opportunities will continue to arise as traditional department stores ramp up their online presence.\n\nThere are spillover effects from the advancement of e-commerce for truckload and LTL carriers. However, the big surges in volumes are primarily felt by the parcel companies for last-mile delivery. The majority of items purchased via e-commerce aren\'t things big enough for truckload or LTL carriers, but they may seek to get more involved in last-mile delivery, especially for larger items like furniture or appliances.\n\nPrime Day is just the most recent and most significant event to showcase the growing prowess of e-commerce. Cyber Monday is another occasion when retailers battle it out through online deals. Cyber Monday occurs on the first Monday following Thanksgiving and the notoriously chaotic Black Friday. The frenzied Black Friday event that drew large hordes of people to traditional brick and mortar stores may have acted as one of the catalysts to things going digital. There is a convenience to going the e-commerce route. You can get better deals with a few taps on your computer, tablet or cell phone instead of subjecting yourself to waiting in long lines, dealing with inclement weather and scrambling for the last off-brand pressure cooker in the back of the store as soon as the store\'s doors open at 5:00 a.m.\n\nThe landscape is altering, and new trends are emerging from the e-commerce boom. One of the few statistics that Amazon shared from Prime Day 2019 shows that more than 100,000 lunchboxes and 100,000 laptops were sold during the two-day event. Consumers may be shifting things like the typical "back-to-school" purchases forward to take advantage of deals now instead of during the traditional August time frame.\n\nOne thing is certain - e-commerce is going to be essential for most traditional brick and mortar stores to stay afloat in the coming years and Amazon is setting the pace. There were 175 million items sold worldwide during Prime Day this year, more than the sales for its 2018 Black Friday and Cyber Monday events combined. Companies will not only be competing on price as in years past, but also online user interface, membership loyalty and speed of delivery. The rise in digital sales for retailers likely means that they will need to build more warehouses and distribution centers to get closer to their final consumer, which may be good news for some LTL and parcel companies.\n\nImage Sourced by Pixabay\n\nWith the next two weeks marking the heart of earnings season, investors keeping tabs on the telecom industry can look for reports from two major companies with diverging strategies - **AT &T Inc.** (NYSE:T) and **Verizon Communications Inc.** (NYSE:VZ).\n\nVZ and T are the two largest wireless carriers in the U.S. by subscribers. T is scheduled to report Q2 earnings before the market open July 24, and competitor VZ is scheduled to report Q2 earnings before the market opens on Aug. 1.\n\nThese companies have roles in communications and media, where the landscape is changing rapidly with new competition, mergers and changing consumer demands, among many other factors. (T and VZ are technically part of the newly formed Communication Services sector, which combined Telecom and Communications.) This quarter, investors can watch for any news of progress on the 5G front from either company, as well as other highlights in business development strategies, among other key data.\n\nSome Wall Street analysts see risks in the wireless industry in an increasingly competitive environment, which could lead to lower pricing and pinch margins. We\'ll have to see how those suspicions shake out this quarter.\n\n  \n**Figure 1: TELECOMS HOLD STRONG**. The telecom sector, represented here by the S&P Telecom Select Industry Index ($SPSITE) with the purple line, is handily outperforming the S&P 500 (SPX), represented by the candlestick line, so far this year. Chart source: The thinkorswim® platform from TD Ameritrade. _For illustrative purposes only. Past performance does not guarantee future results_.\n\n### Verizon Targeting 5G\n\nLately, Verizon\'s main effort has been in getting started in the 5G game. It\'s recently been building out its 5G network, which claimed a large chunk of its $4.3 billion expenditures. It\'s planning to launch the 5G network in 30 major cities this year. For consumers who can tap into it, 5G can offer speeds of about 10 times faster than they might normally get.\n\nSo far, the rollout has been largely symbolic because most consumers don\'t have the Motorola phone for the clip-on modem that will upgrade the service, nor is the infrastructure build out completed. However it offers potential for revenue growth for a number of companies in the communications sector besides VZ, including T. Verizon has said it will not likely see revenue from 5G upgrades until 2020.\n\nLast quarter, VZ reported earnings of $1.22 per share, up from $1.17 per share the same quarter the year prior and well ahead of the analyst estimate. Revenue was $32.1 billion, up from $31.8 billion the year prior, about on par with expectations. It had 61,000 net new additions to its postpaid retail wireless business in Q1.\n\nVZ shares are essentially flat so far this year, as of July 22, versus the S&P 500\'s (SPX) rise of 19%.\n\nVZ is expected to report adjusted EPS of $1.20, right on par with the prior-year quarter, according to third-party consensus analyst estimates. Revenue is projected at $32.4 billion, up 0.6% from $32.2 billion a year ago.\n\n### Verizon Options Activity\n\nThe options market has priced in about a 1.6% stock move in either direction around the coming earnings release.\n\nPut option volume has been light, but most active at the 55 and 56 strike. Calls have been more active, with volume concentrated at the 58 and 59 strikes. Implied volatility was at the 34th percentile.\n\n_Note: Call options represent the right, but not the obligation, to buy the underlying security at a predetermined price over a set period of time. Put options represent the right, but not the obligation, to sell the underlying security at a predetermined price over a set period of time._\n\n### AT&T Targeting Streaming\n\nAT&T is the second-largest U.S. wireless carrier by subscriber numbers. Like VZ, it\'s getting in the 5G game with a planned rollout of 5G networks, where it\'s still laying a foundation.\n\nIn another move that analysts believe has the potential to pay off in the long-term, T has announced a partnership with **IBM**(NYSE:IBM) that should help modernize its internal software applications. Under the multi-year agreement, IBM will provide infrastructure to support T\'s business applications.\n\nAT&T also seems to be more focused on its media business. Recently, it unveiled plans for HBO Max, a streaming service launching next spring that will compete with the likes of **Netflix Inc.  **(NASDAQ:NFLX) and **Amazon.com, Inc.** \'s (NASDAQ:AMZN) Amazon Prime. It will have the exclusive rights to popular shows like _Friends_ , _The Fresh Prince of Bel Air_ , _Big Little Lies_ , among others.\n\nT\'s debt load, which many analysts say is significantly high, is also likely to continue to be on investors\' radars again this quarter. It held $169 billion in debt at the end of last quarter, and investors will soon learn whether its efforts to pare back its debt are continuing to have any impact. In the first quarter, it said it deleveraged $2.3 billion.\n\nLast quarter, T shares fell for the fifth consecutive quarter as revenue missed guidance in part on lower-than-expected sales in its WarnerMedia unit, which holds premium channel HBO and Turner as well as the upcoming HBO Max.\n\nT is expected to report adjusted EPS of $0.89, up from $0.91 per share in the prior-year quarter, according to third-party consensus analyst estimates. Revenue is projected at $44.83 billion, up 15% from $38.99 billion a year ago.\n\nSo far this year, shares of T have made substantial strides compared to VZ, with the stock up about 14% as of July 22.\n\n### AT&T Options Activity\n\nThe options market has priced in an expected share price move of about 3.9% in either direction around the earnings release, according to the Market Maker Move™ indicator on the thinkorswim® platform.\n\nCall activity has been higher at the 34 strikes while put activity has concentrated at the 32 and 33 strikes. The implied volatility sits at the 37th percentile.\n\n_Information from TDA is not intended to be investment advice or construed as a recommendation or endorsement of any particular investment or investment strategy, and is for illustrative purposes only.

 'Tech giants in the FAANG group should weather Justice Department antitrust scrutiny over the long term, Wedbush said Wednesday after a report of a broadening probe.\n\n### **What Happened**\n\nThe Wall Street Journal first reported the Justice Department will investigate tech antitrust questions, likely including **Apple Inc**. (NASDAQ:AAPL), **Facebook Inc**. (NASDAQ:FB), **Amazon.com Inc**. (NASDAQ:AMZN) and **Alphabet Inc**. (NASDAQ:GOOGL)\'s Google. Another probe by the Federal Trade Commission also is ongoing.\n\nBut breakups of the companies are unlikely, analyst Daniel Ives said, adding heightened government interest may even prove positive.\n\n**Major Shot Across Bow**\n\nIves acknowledged in a note the DOJ was firing a "major shot" across the tech bow, and the investigations could be a short-term overhang on the stocks.\n\nBut, "we ultimately believe this is more noise vs. the start of broader structural changes across the tech food chain and will likely result in business model tweaks and potential DOJ/ FTC fines in a worst-case scenario rather than forced breakups of the underlying businesses," Ives wrote.\n\n"We would encourage investors to focus on the fundamentals in the near-term as any probe would take many years to complete," Ives added.\n\nIves also noted investigations into business models sometimes spur innovation and diversification, noting Facebook has announced a move into cryptocurrency and Google has acquired a cloud data analytics business.\n\n**Online Sentiment Dropped**\n\nInvestor sentiment data compiled by StockTwits showed that after the WSJ story hit Tuesday afternoon, several of the companies saw significant drops in investor sentiment.\n\nAlphabet saw one of the biggest, going from an average of 83% bullish in early afternoon to 57% bullish later in the day. Amazon and Facebook saw drops in bullishness on StockTwits, though much smaller, and both remained at or above 70% bullish after the story. Apple sentiment was essentially flat.\n\nAll four of the mentioned stocks were down slightly Wednesday, with Amazon seeing the biggest drop, off 0.59% to $1,982.82.\n\n_Related Links:_\n\n_Mnuchin Defends DOJ Antitrust Probe, Confirms Trip To China_\n\n_Facebook, FTC To Settle Privacy Charges For $5B_\n\nInvestors watching the Dow Jones Industrial Average ($DJI) might get a skewed picture today, as the $DJI could come under more pressure than other indices due to pressure from some of its main components.\n\nWeak earnings from **Caterpillar Inc** (NYSE:CAT) and **Boeing Co**  (NYSE:BA)--along with possible rough sledding for  some of the big financials amid falling Treasury yields--might gang up on the $DJI today even as the broader S&P 500 (SPX) takes less of a pounding. At the same time, the Nasdaq (COMP), dominated by technology companies, could struggle as investors react to a government investigation of some of the biggest Technology and Communication Services sector firms.\n\nEarnings keep coming fast and furious, and results early Wednesday ranged from pretty good to dramatically bad.\n\nOn the good side, there was **United Parcel Service, Inc.**  (NYSE:UPS) beating on top- and bottom-lines and reaffirming guidance. It might be interesting to hear what executives say about the delivery business, which sometimes can be a canary in a coal mine when it comes to economic strength. Last month, **FedEx Corporation** (NYSE:FDX) warned that a slowing world economy posed a threat.\n\n**AT &T Inc.** (NYSE:T) looked decent enough on the surface, beating analysts\' average earnings per share estimate. However, the company suffered a net loss of 778,000 premium video subscribers in the quarter, mostly DirecTV satellite. That\'s arguably T\'s earnings in a nutshell. The streaming wars continue to have effects not just on the streaming companies but on traditional cable companies, too. This is a hard blow for T. They did beat on sales, which is positive, and they are planning to get in the streaming game themselves soon, including with the launch of WarnerMedia\'s HBO Max. But losing that many subscribers might not be well received, and the stock edged lower in pre-market trading.\n\nOn the bad side, earnings from Boeing (BA) showed a quarter the company would probably like to forget. While analysts already expected disappointment, the actual results were way below expectations. BA reported a deep earnings per share loss and missed analysts\' revenue projections by more than $2 billion.\n\nIt\'s a bit of a head-scratcher to see the stock down less than 1% in pre-market trading, but maybe that\'s because no one was expecting a bed of roses as the company wrestles with its 737 MAX issue. The really important thing is to see what executives have to say about when they think the troubled plane can get back into the skies.\n\nMore rocky Q2 news from the Industrial sector surfaced early Wednesday as Caterpillar (CAT) missed earnings expectations by a pretty big margin. Revenue came in as expected, but lower Chinese demand was a flashing light in CAT\'s earnings press release. Here in the U.S., the company\'s Energy and Transportation unit took a hit amid falling demand from the oil-producing Permian Basin. This might be something to consider looking ahead to some Energy sector company reports.\n\nCAT shares fell about 4% in pre-market trading, but the good thing is the company maintained its profit guidance and forecast modest revenue growth for the full year.\n\nOutside of earnings, another thing to consider keeping an eye on today is the Technology sector. A late news flash yesterday about the Department of Justice (DOJ) opening an antitrust review of big-tech companies hurt some shares in post-market trading.\n\nA few of the companies that might see an impact from the investigation include **Facebook, Inc.** (NASDAQ:FB), **Amazon.com, Inc.**  (NASDAQ:AMZN), **Alphabet Inc** (NASDAQ:GOOG) and **Apple Inc** (NASDAQ:AAPL), according to The Wall Street Journal. The government is investigating how the companies achieved market power and if they\'re engaging in practices that have reduced competition, stifled innovation, or otherwise harmed consumers. This looks like one of those ongoing things that might be a background worry for investors over the coming months, though it\'s hard to say how much of a long-term impact it might have on share prices. \n\n**Facebook, Inc.** (NASDAQ:FB), **Ford Motor Company** (NYSE:F), and **Tesla Inc** (NASDAQ:TSLA) dominate this afternoon\'s earnings picture, so investors might want to keep on their toes for any possible surprises. With FB possibly one of the targets of the DOJ probe, any comments about that on FB\'s earnings call might get extra attention. The company was already expected to spend some time on its call addressing privacy issues and a potential $5 billion fine from the Federal Trade Commission (FTC).\n\nArguably the biggest (and best) news of the quarter for TSLA has already been digested. The company reported better-than-expected car deliveries for the second quarter. One question executives might get asked is how they\'ll meet their projected delivery goals for the full year.\n\n### China Talks Return to the Front Burner\n\nAn early rally Tuesday picked up steam after reports that the U.S. and China would be talking face-to-face again about trade next week. That helped the S&P 500 Index (SPX) climb back above 3000 after dipping below 2980 on Monday. Tuesday marked the first time the SPX closed above 3000 in a week.\n\nNot to rain on any parades, but these U.S./China talks really need to be looked at in the right context. Through the trade saga, some people have put way too much focus on individual events. It\'s just one meeting, and it\'s hard to believe anything is going to get settled right away, especially when you consider how talks ended last time with both sides hardening their positions. \n\nWhile the rally on Tuesday looked nice, this recent move hasn\'t been too easy to characterize. It seems like a different sector or group of sectors leads every day. On Tuesday, it was Financials, Materials, and Industrials, with some of those probably benefiting a bit from the China news. It could be some other sector today. It\'s difficult to find any trends and there\'s really no consistency. \n\n### Dollar Hits Highest Point in More Than a Month\n\nThis week\'s rally in stocks coincided with a rally in the U.S. dollar, which maybe seems a little surprising with the market signaling a rate cut coming. The dollar drew support early this week in part because U.S rates are still relatively high compared with negative ones in Europe and Japan, and also from analyst concern associated with a new British Prime Minister taking office. The political situation in London looks like it weighed on the British pound, and also the euro.\n\nAmid all the European worries--and ahead of tomorrow\'s European Central Bank (ECB) rate decision--it simply looked like the dollar was the strongest game in town, rate cut or no rate cut. The dollar index traded above 97.7 on Tuesday, the highest it\'s been since early last month.\n\nWe\'ve already heard some early reporting companies talk about the higher dollar and its impact on their Q2 results. Today brings a host of company earnings where a strong U.S. currency could have an impact, including Boeing, Caterpillar, and Ford. It might be interesting to hear if executives on those calls mention any currency effects. \n\nBig financial stocks delivered a solid performance pretty much across the board on Tuesday. However, rates are lower in pre-market trading early today, so that might put pressure on some of the Financial companies that shined yesterday. \n\nConsumer demand has been a big part of the rally these last few weeks, but maybe that got challenged a bit late Tuesday when **Visa Inc  **(NYSE:V) reported its results. The company came in ahead of third-party consensus for revenue and earnings, but gave its full-year guidance a small haircut.\n\nVisa\'s stock has had an amazing run, so it wasn\'t too surprising to see its shares fall about 2% in post-market trading after that news. The fact is, however, that payments volume growth of 9% in V\'s quarter looked really strong, and might back up what **JPMorgan Chase & Co** (NYSE:JPM) said last week about credit card balances growing. So it\'s really looking like a stretch to say V\'s guidance cut necessarily disproves the thesis about a strong consumer.\n\nIf you\'re looking for a couple of names whose stock moved the opposite direction of Visa\'s in the after hours yesterday, **Snap Inc  **(NYSE:SNAP) and **Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.  **(NYSE:CMG) both come to mind. SNAP shares climbed 11% after the company reported stronger than expected Q2 user growth, while CMG beat third-party consensus estimates for revenue and earnings and saw its shares rise 4% in post-market trading. The company also raised its 2019 same-store sales outlook. CMG shares have been an investor darling all year and earnings don\'t appear likely to change that.\n\n  \n**Figure 1: BACK IN THE GREEN** : The dollar index (candlestick) hit its highest level in more than a month Tuesday despite continued weakness in U.S. 10-year Treasury yields (purple line). Normally the dollar doesn\'t climb with the Fed on the verge of a rate cut, but the U.S. economy and interest rates are still among the strongest around, which might be attracting investors to the country\'s currency. Data Source: ICE, Cboe Global Markets. Chart source: The thinkorswim® platform from TD Ameritrade. _For illustrative purposes only. Past performance does not guarantee future results._\n\n**Fed Wins in a Knockout** : While corporate results helped lift stocks early this week, so did that old adage, "Don\'t fight the Fed." Futures prices predict a 25 basis-point rate cut next week, so many investors appear to be taking the path of least resistance and bidding up stocks. At times like these, the soft economic data numbers seen in housing and manufacturing early Tuesday might actually be more helpful than positive outcomes, because they simply reinforce what people expect the Fed to do. \n\nThat said, it\'s not necessarily a good idea to ignore disappointing June existing home sales, which fell 1.7% to a 5.27 million pace after climbing 2.9% to a revised 5.36 million clip in May. Sales in June were down 2.2% year over year, with both single-family and multi-family homes lagging. This is despite lower mortgage rates, and could tell us that consumers still aren\'t too wild to make big purchases. Also, the Richmond Fed manufacturing index dropped 14 points to -12 in July, the lowest since January 2013. The unexpected weakness was broadbased. These data, along with earnings growth that\'s been a little above expectations but still relatively low, play into that same hymnal about not fighting the Fed, but also raise some eyebrows about exactly what kind of economic environment we\'re in.\n\n**Getting Social** : This week includes some key earnings "posts" from social media companies, including Facebook and **Twitter Inc  **(NYSE:TWTR). Looking at the social media landscape going into earnings, there\'s a lot of focus on potential regulatory issues, and a key thing to consider is that companies under a government shadow might see less of a potential bullish response if their earnings beat. It looks like there could be an extra layer of pressure because of what might happen next. Even if they have killer earnings, the fact that they\'re in the crosshairs could limit gains. That dynamic arguably played out last week when Johnson & Johnson (JNJ)--the subject of a Justice Department probe--didn\'t get much lift despite an impressive earnings performance across the entire company.\n\n**Beyond Discretionary with Amazon** : Another chapter in the positive consumer story might be written tomorrow after the close when Amazon (AMZN) reports earnings, assuming AMZN benefits from strong U.S. employment and consumer confidence. Though AMZN is officially listed as a consumer discretionary company, it\'s AMZN\'s cloud business where a lot of the earnings excitement rests. In Q1, Amazon Web Services sales rose 41% year-over-year, so investors are likely to watch the Q2 results closely to see if AMZN was able to keep the hot run going.\n\nAs many analysts point out, the cloud is where much of AMZN\'s profit growth is coming from and one of the fastest-growing revenue areas, too, but some expect growth in Q2 to fall below 40%. Commercial cloud revenue growth was 39% at competitor Microsoft (MSFT) in the company\'s latest quarter, with its infrastructure platform Azure growing 64%. However, the Azure growth slowed from the previous quarter, and some analysts are wondering if this slowing growth might have an impact at AMZN, too.\n\n_Information from TDA is not intended to be investment advice or construed as a recommendation or endorsement of any particular investment or investment strategy, and is for illustrative purposes only.

One such potential example includes **Amazon.com, Inc.** (NASDAQ:AMZN) who "destroyed the retail industry" across the country and there is "no question" their is limited competitors to challenge the e-commerce company.\n\nMnuchin did say he doesn\'t have an opinion either way and he "looks forward" to any recommendations and findings from the relevant government bodies.\n\n### Packing For China\n\nMnuchin and U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer will be flying to China on Monday for at least two days, the secretary said. The trade delegation will be in Shanghai at the invitation of the Chinese government and this could be seen as a sign of progress towards a trade agreement.\n\nA finalized trade deal is unlikely to be reached next week as a follow up meeting is likely to take place in Washington, he said.\n\nOne of the more pressing issues is Huawei\'s unclear status to conduct business with U.S. companies.

Perhaps investors may get some fresh news to give the stock more momentum after a sluggish quarter these past few months.\n\nSeveral Wall Street analysts have cited the lack of transparency as a main concern with the company last quarter. So, maybe now executives may offer some clarity around earnings trends, whether or not there\'s signs of revived growth this time around. We\'ll have to see.\n\nGOOGL is expected to report adjusted EPS of $11.30, up from $4.54 in the prior-year quarter, according to third-party consensus analyst estimates. Revenue is projected at $38.17 billion, up 16.9% from $32.6 billion a year ago.\n\n### Where Q1 Results Triggered Concerns\n\nLast quarter, GOOGL reported earnings of $11.90 per share, higher than the $10.61 the Street expected. But its revenue of $36.34 billion, which included decelerating ad revenue, fell nearly $1 billion short of expectations.\n\nAlphabet revenue was up 17% year over year in Q1, which is substantial, however it\'s off from the more than 20% consistent revenue growth it had been seeing, including 20% growth in the year prior. Furthermore, its ad revenue grew 15%, paling in comparison to the 24% growth the year prior.\n\nIt was the slowest sales growth the company has seen since 2015, but executives did not directly address the subject on its conference call. Instead, they focused on pockets of significant growth in the company such as areas of mobile search, cloud and YouTube.\n\nShares of GOOGL the past quarter have not been up to the torrid pace of the Technology sector. They\'re up close to 9% as of July 24, whereas the tech-heavy Nasdaq (COMP) has gained 25% during that same time. Just before its Q1 report, GOOGL was up 24% year to date hitting record highs, so it\'s losses since have been significant. Although keep in mind that shares have made some recovery in the last month.\n\n### What to Consider Watching in the Numbers\n\nOne of GOOGL\'s key metrics is its paid clicks, which show whether traffic volumes are growing. A larger audience can help offset any price reduction in ads. Last quarter, paid clicks were up 39% year over year, which again sounds like a lot until you consider that they were up 66% in the prior quarter and up 62% in the quarter before that. The company\'s finance chief attributed the slumping growth to changes they company made in its YouTube user experience. So, keep your eye out for whether growth in paid clicks made any recover in Q2.\n\nAlso, consider watching GOOGL\'s traffic acquisition costs, which are mainly what it pays companies to be the default search engine or for other ways of generating traffic to its website. In recent years, the company has been able to keep this figure fairly stable, even beating analysts\' expectations last quarter when it reported $6.8 billion for the metric.\n\nMargins, which were lackluster last quarter, may also be in the spotlight. Q1 profit and operating margins shrunk as it invested more in hiring and YouTube as well as data centers. We\'ll see whether those costs are continuing to balloon, or whether GOOGL has scaled back there.\n\nFinally, take a look outside of GOOGL\'s main search engine business for how its other endeavors like its cloud computing, hardware businesses and new video streaming service Stadia are faring. Or maybe watch for what else it may have in the pipeline, say with driverless cars or other innovations that could drive growth.\n\nAs a side note, consider digging a bit deeper to look at how much GOOGL is spending on its cloud business as it tries to compete with **Mircrosoft Corporation** \'s** **(NASDAQ:MSFT) Azure and **Amazon.com, Inc.  **(NASDAQ:AMZN)** ** Web Services, which are dominating that market. If history is any indication, that cost should be a pretty good part of its overall costs, and this quarter\'s figures will reveal whether those costs are increasing or not.\n\n### Alphabet Options Activity\n\nThe options market has priced in an expected share price move of 4.3% in either direction around the earnings release, according to the Market Maker Move™ indicator on the thinkorswim® platform.\n\nOptions activity has been light in both the **Class A** (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and **Class C** (NASDAQ:GOOG) shares. There has been some put activity at the GOOGL 1120 and 1125 strikes, but the highest concentration has been way to the upside, in the GOOGL 1200 calls. The implied volatility sits at the 41st percentile as of today. \n\n_Note: Call options represent the right, but not the obligation, to buy the underlying security at a predetermined price over a set period of time.

The ECB nished its meeting today without announcing a new rate cut, but hinted strongly that one could happen in September.   \nThe ECB hasn\'t cut rates since 2016, and the economy there continues to sputter. Yesterday included weak manufacturing data from Germany. Low rates in Europe can pump up the dollar vs. the euro. So anything the ECB ends up doing could have an impact on the U.S. market.   \nA strong dollar is already causing some problems for big U.S. companies selling products overseas, and the situation got more serious early Thursday as the dollar index climbed toward 98. Just a month ago it was under 96. It hasn\'t been over 98 since May.   \nThe other impact of low rates in Europe is pressure on U.S. rates. The U.S. 10-year Treasury yield fell early Thursday to just over 2.01%, and looks like it could threaten to fall below 2% again. One reason some analysts think the Fed is likely to cut rates next week is to put them more in line with rates overseas, though U.S. borrowing costs would still be way above those in Europe. \n\n### Earnings Continue to Impress--Mostly \n\nBack home, it\'s been a pretty good earnings season overall, and the drumbeat continues this afternoon with two of the biggest names of all, **Amazon.com, Inc.  **(NASDAQ:AMZN) and **Alphabet Inc  **(NASDAQ:GOOG). So far, 75% of companies have reported better-than-expected earnings per share, according to FactSet. We\'re about one-third of the way through earnings season.   \nBefore hearing from AMZN and GOOGL later today, the morning papers landed at the front door with good news from **3M Co  **(NYSE:MMM), **Bristol-Myers Squibb Co** (NYSE:BMY), and **American Airlines Group** (NASDAQ:AAL), which all beat Wall Street\'s earnings per share estimates. Last night saw nice results from **Facebook, Inc.  **(NASDAQ:FB), but the brakes slammed over at **Tesla Inc  **(NASDAQ:TSLA), which very much under-delivered and remains a tough one to gure out.   \nThough TSLA missed analysts\' earnings per share projections, it did stick to its guidance for 2019 vehicle sales. The company has reported losses two quarters in a row after two quarters of pro t last year, and the stock fell more than 11% in pre-market trading.   \nWhile FB stock initially climbed 3% after reporting, it quickly backtracked to slight losses despite topping third- party consensus on both top and bottom lines. That kind of tepid response might reflect what we talked about earlier this week regarding how companies under regulatory scrutiny might not see strong gains even if quarterly results impress. The stock did climb again in pre-market trading.   \nOn a positive note, beer consumption is up. That\'s the read from **Anheuser-Busch InBev** (NYSE:BUD), which reported earnings and sales above analysts\' estimates. Beer volumes rose 2.2% in the quarter.   \n**PayPal Holdings Inc.  **(NASDAQ:PYPL) beat on earnings but missed on revenue. Still, the company reported 9 million active new accounts and raised guidance. A lot of analysts upgraded the stock.   \nGoing back to MMM a minute, the company had really good earnings, and their CEO talked about great progress in the face of continued slow growth conditions. He didn\'t emphasize sales as much as improved cash flow and managing costs. This could be seen as a cautionary note.   \nIn data news, June durable goods came in better than expected. The rst government estimate for Q2 gross domestic product (GDP) comes tomorrow. \n\n### Conundrums and Confusion \n\nIf there\'s a predictable thing about the markets, it\'s that they often act unpredictably. Wednesday\'s action was a good example.   \nFor instance, crude prices crumbled despite a huge weekly draw out of U.S. stockpiles. The Technology sector performed pretty well even though just the day before the government announced a Department of Justice investigation that might a ect some of the sector\'s biggest rms.   \nAt the same time, earnings continued to o er people their choice of what company\'s lens they want to view things through. This is a conundrum for all market participants now. Which signal do you look at to say how the market is doing?   \nFor instance, do you look at Caterpillar, whose quarter ran into a China roadblock, and say China is a big problem going forward and that\'s the main story for the market?   \nOr do you see it through the lens of **Texas Instruments Incorporated** (TXN), which had a fantastic quarter all around and helped the Semiconductor sector throw a Wall Street party Wednesday? Some analysts see the chip market as a barometer of global growth, so if chip companies do well, doesn\'t that mean things are generally OK? It all depends on how you look at things.   \nStill, we aren\'t completely through the chip industry reporting season, with **Intel Corporation  **(NASDAQ:INTC) earnings still ahead and that company often o ering a di erent take on the sector. That\'s why it\'s too soon to say the chip sector has bottomed. The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index rose more than 3% Wednesday.   \nAnother lens to look through comes from **Visa Inc  **(NYSE:V), whose earnings beat expectations for every aspect of the business. This brings us back to the consumer, who ultimately seems to be driving the current stock market rally.   \nOne thing predictable thing about Wednesday was the Dow Jones Industrial Average\'s ($DJI) underperformance compared with the S&P 500 (SPX) and Nasdaq (COMP). Disappointing earnings results from $DJI components **Caterpillar Inc  **(NYSE:CAT) and **Boeing Co  **(NYSE:BA) had a lot to do with that, but even there you had a little bit of unpredictability because most of the big nancial stocks rose despite declining rates.   \nSpeaking of unpredictable markets, U.S. crude stocks fell more than 10 million barrels in the most recent weekly update from the government, but crude pulled back sharply Wednesday. It looks like analysts shook o the report by saying it reflected lower production and imports due to the hurricane a couple weeks ago. If you look at the U.S. crude chart over the last month, $55 a barrel has been a pretty clear support point, and the market bounced again late Wednesday after falling below $56. \n\n### Volatility Fades as Rally Continues \n\nOne thing nding almost no support this week is the Cboe Volatility Index (VIX), which descended down toward 12 on Wednesday and seems to be getting ready for its summer slumber. The last two summers saw VIX spend a lot of time under 12. The VIX fell under 12 intraday Wednesday for the rst time since mid-April. It had climbed well over 20 back in May.   \nIt\'s hard to see that happening this year considering all the China trade and Brexit worries, but the agreement this week between Congress and the White House to raise the debt ceiling and keep the government opened might have helped lower the volatility volume a little for now. Also, earnings being a little stronger than many analysts had expected might be calming things down a bit.   \nThe wild card for volatility, besides those geopolitical factors, might end up being the Fed. While futures prices have baked in a 25-basis point rate cut next week, there\'s uncertainty about what comes next (see more below). If the Fed throws a curveball in its statement or press conference, we could see VIX roar back.  \n**Fed Expected to Ease This Month, But Then What?** Chances of a 25-basis point hike less than a week from now stand at approximately 75%, according to CME Group futures. Odds of a 50 basis-point cut in July have receded. Already, however, investors are looking beyond next week\'s meeting and wondering what\'s next. The futures market signals a couple more rate cuts this year, but what will Fed Chairman Jerome Powell say about those chances next week? His words could have a big impact.   \nOne thing that could work its way into the Fed\'s playbook is gross domestic product (GDP). The Atlanta Fed\'s GDPNow meter predicts 1.6% growth in Q2, and many Wall Street analysts don\'t see much of a comeback in  Q3 and Q4. However, if GDP starts to look better than expected, that could mean the Fed starts to push back on calls for another rate cut after this month. If the Fed vocally pushes back in either its statement or at Powell\'s press conference next week, that could potentially change the bullish feelings around the stock market a bit.   \n**GDP Talk as Q2 Estimate Looms Friday** : Since we\'re talking about GDP, one interesting thing that\'s come up this earnings season is a few CEOs saying that Boeing\'s 737 MAX issue may be a ecting some earnings, which could potentially could have an impact on GDP. Another potential pressure point on growth could be companies consolidating operations, like this week\'s news about **Apple Inc  **(NASDAQ:AAPL) considering a purchase of Intel\'s smartphone modem-chip business. If companies start producing more of their own things, it could cut some other companies out of the chain.   \nThe Fed is likely to provide a look next week at its own projections for growth in the second half, and tomorrow brings the government\'s rst look at Q2 GDP growth. Analysts see growth of just 1.8%, according to Brie ng.com, which would be the lowest since Q1 of 2017 and down from 3.1% in Q1. A Wall Street Journal analyst survey shows average GDP estimates of under 2% for the nal two quarters of this year, as well.   \n**Manufacturing Still Slumbers** : A new batch of manufacturing readings early Wednesday didn\'t exactly build con dence in the economy\'s current performance, as manufacturing PMI slipped 0.6 points to 50.0 in July, down from 50.6 in June and down from 55.3 from a year ago. It\'s the worst reading since September 2009, but it\'s still holding just above a contractionary sub-50 level. Output fell to 48.9, however, versus 51.2 in June, reversing the expansionary trend.   \nNew home sales for June also came in below expectations, with downward adjustments to the April and May numbers. "Overall sales activity remains tepid despite the fundamental supports of low mortgage rates, low unemployment, and a tight supply of existing homes for sale," Brie ng.com noted. Maybe investors can get a better sense of demand for new homes next week when homebuilder **D.R. Horton Inc** (NYSE:DHI) before the Tuesday\'s open.\n\n_Information fromTDA is not intended to be investment advice or construed as a recommendation or endorsement of any particular investment or investment strategy, and is for illustrative purposes only.

Digital marketplaces catering to small businesses in the B2B world have been mostly non-existent, despite global B2B e-commerce estimated to be a $24 trillion industry. What\'s more, setting up an online store on a site like Alibaba.com, the core platform of the Chinese e-commerce giant, to sell to Chinese businesses could cost between $800,000 and $1 million, beyond the reach of most small business budgets.\n\nThe days of SMBs being ushered to the back of the bus are gone, however. Any doubters need only witness the events of July 23 to understand the sea-change. Yesterday morning, **Alibaba**(NYSE:BABA) announced it would offer Alibaba.com. to the U.S. small business market, putting the 190-country platform in front of 30 million American sellers, including those who want to sell within the U.S. Yesterday afternoon, transport and logistics giant **UPS Inc**. (NYSE:UPS) rolled out a slew of products aimed at the shipping and logistics needs of the small- to mid-size segment. These include seven day a week pick-ups and deliveries, extended pick-up times for next-day ground deliveries, an increase in pick-up and drop-off nodes known as access points, inexpensive global shipping of low-priced items, proposed full-blown commercial drone operations, and an expanded visibility and package flow platform known as "My Choice."\n\nIn the space of about 12 hours, the SMB category saw its stature elevated exponentially. But Alibaba and UPS aren\'t the only ones clamoring for SMB action. **FedEx Corp**. (NYSE:FDX) has made SMB penetration a top priority, and has already announced seven-day-a-week service, extended pick-up times and expanded access points targeted at that market. **Amazon.com, Inc.** (NASDAQ:AMZN) considers SMBs the lifeblood of its business, with its "Fulfillment by Amazon" service, in which smaller merchants use the company as its marketing, fulfillment and delivery partner, representing more than half of its total sales.\n\nWhile they began in different places - Alibaba and Amazon in retail and FedEx and UPS in shipping - the lines of demarcation appear to be fading as the four converge on the business-to-business SMB sector. For example, UPS has built platforms like UPS e-fulfillment, an integrated service for storage, pick, pack and shipping services called "Ware2Go," and "My Choice for Business" that have taken the company well beyond its traditional mandate. Amazon has evolved from a book and CD seller into a shipping and logistics giant, with most of its investment today aimed at expanding its distribution and delivery network. About 14 years after its founding, Alibaba in 2013 created Cainiao Logistics along with eight other partners to serve as its logistics unit. A couple of years ago, however, Alibaba took majority ownership of the unit and has since been expanding it across Asia and North America. \n\nMichael Zakkour, who runs the global digital commerce unit of Tompkins International, a logistics and supply chain management consultancy, said Alibaba, through Cainiao, has been forging partnerships with U.S.-based carriers and third-party logistics providers. Zakkour, who has followed Alibaba for years, said it is unlikely to pursue an Amazon-like strategy of building out its own shipping network, and will instead rely on partnerships. Another difference, according to Zakkour, is that Alibaba would never position itself as a partner and competitor, unlike Amazon which competes with its partners. "It is against their culture. It is not who they are," said Zakkour, referring to Alibaba.\n\nUPS is a preferred shipping provider, and, according to UPS spokesman Steve Gaut, it sees the opportunity to support many of Alibaba\'s small business sellers with its new "worldwide economy" service, which offers five- to 12-day transit times for low-priced goods moving in cross-border e-commerce.\n\nThen there is **JD.com** (NYSE:JD), the Chinese logistics and e-commerce giant whose shipping network is unrivaled in size and scope, but which is still predominantly China-centric (although it has expanded to other Asian points). In March, JD launched a store to sell its products on Google Express, the online shopping site owned by the unit of **Alphabet Inc**. (NASDAQ:GOOG). The store\'s launch came less than a year after Google agreed to invest $550 million in JD. However, for JD to become a key player in the SMB market in the U.S., it will have to eventually build its own footprint, said Zakkour.\n\nThe erection of these giant ecosystems and the three backbones of the future -  logistics, technology and an embrace of the new retail environment - has one overarching goal, according to Zakkour. He said it is to become a global version of Amazon Prime, the popular service where free one-day shipping is available to Prime members on more than 10 million items, a number that will inevitably grow. The mission over the next couple of years, Zakkour explained, is to offer guaranteed two- to three-day deliveries between any two points anywhere in the world, he said. The differentiator will not be the product selection or even their cost, he said. It will be in the reliability of getting it there. The vendor that does it best will win the wallets of SMBs and their customers.\n\nImage sourced from Pixabay\n\nFor most of the 21st century, next-day air deliveries in the U.S. have wallowed in the transport dustbin, considered an expensive relic of the past as businesses migrated to lower-cost, short- to intermediate-haul ground alternatives. Now in mid-2019, the skies have become - shall we say it - chic.\n\n**UPS Inc**. (NYSE:UPS) reported on Wednesday, July 24 that next-day air volumes in its second quarter surged by 30 percent over the year-earlier period, a pace of year-on-year gains that no one can ever recall. The numbers were likely skewed by volumes from e-tailer **Amazon.com, Inc**. (NASDAQ:AMZN) which migrated to UPS after **FedEx Corp**. (NYSE:FDX) said in early June that it wouldn\'t renew its U.S. air services contract with Amazon.\n\nStill, coming on the heels of UPS reporting an 8 percent year-on-year increase in the first quarter, Wednesday\'s results indicate that after 20 years in the desert, next-day air has found a trend - namely the push toward one-day delivery spearheaded by Amazon\'s move to compress delivery commitments for users of its "Prime" service - it can sink its teeth into.\n\nFueled by the next-day air spike, UPS\' domestic segment revenue increased 7.7 percent to $11.1 billion, while adjusted operating profit rose 8 percent. This helped UPS post adjusted second quarter earnings per share of $1.96, three cents above analysts\' median estimates. It also propelled UPS\' shares to their best one-day gain since October 2008. Shares climbed by $9.12, an 8.66 percent gain, to close at $114.39. \n\nUPS has gone all-in on airfreight. It plans to take delivery off 44 freighters by 2022, with 11 of them delivered in 2019 to go along with the original seven aircraft. With the deliveries, UPS will add 10 million pounds of air capacity, which it touts as more than any other carrier.\n\nBy contrast, FedEx, which built its empire around air express services, has de-emphasized its air operations in favor of lower-cost ground deliveries, a strategy it believes will meet the ever-increasing demands of e-commerce shippers and users at a lower cost. "Our sense is FedEx\'s strategy to profitably grow with e-commerce customers involves embracing the long-term trend of more localized inventory, shorter lengths of haul for parcel carriers, and the ability of large e-commerce players to increasingly meet their customers\' overnight delivery expectations through ground operations without putting that freight on an airplane," said Bascome Majors, transport analyst for investment firm Susquehanna Financial Group. \n\nMajors added that the direction of the two companies is a "continuation of a longer-term trend in the U.S. parcel market: FedEx seeking to gain share in UPS\' historic stronghold of ground (parcel), and UPS encroaching on FedEx\'s historic strength in express."  \nFor UPS investors, perhaps the most positive takeaway is that the company reported positive operating leverage in its U.S. operations in the quarter, the first time in four years it could make that claim. UPS has poured billions of dollars into a multi-year plan to reengineer its domestic network to meet e-commerce demands. At the core of the strategy is the development of multiple mega-hubs with dramatically accelerated package throughput capabilities. UPS delivers about 20 million pieces per day; the improved productivity has led to UPS\' cost per-piece handled to fall to levels not seen\n\nfor several years. As a result, company executives said Wednesday that they expect full-year, double-digit operating gains for its three units.\n\nBesides the gains in the domestic air and ground business, the company\'s supply chain and freight segments, which includes its less-than-truckload (LTL), logistics, brokerage and international freight forwarding, posted solid operating results as cost-containment measures and a focus on "revenue quality" offset flat revenue blamed on global macroeconomic pressures. The company\'s international package segment was also hurt by global macro concerns as well as tough comparisons over 2018, when export volumes rose 9.5 percent.\n\nOverall, revenue for the nation\'s largest transportation company rose 3.4 percent to $18 billion. Adjusted operating profit grew 6.3 percent, while operating margins expanded by 170 basis points. \n\nThe company projected that 2019 earnings per share would range between $7.45 and $7.75 on an adjusted and diluted basis. Adjusted free cash flow will range between $3.5 and $4 billion with possible upside potential as the company moves through the re-engineering initiative\n\nThe second quarter results exclude a $21 million pre-tax charge for implementing the strategy. Second quarter 2018 results excluded a $263 million after-tax charge to fund the company\'s voluntary retirement program, UPS said.\n\nImage sourced from Pixabay\n\nEarnings season can feel like a Category 5 hurricane, and right now we\'re entering the eye of the storm. Hundreds of firms have rained down financial data upon eager investors, and there are hundreds more still to follow.\n\nTo predict whether the current climate of strong corporate growth will persevere, it might be useful to take a look at some of this morning\'s economic data. April showers did not, in fact, bring May flowers in the realm of Durable Goods orders, as New Orders suffered a 1.3% decline. But it appears that there were winds of change at play, with this morning\'s report for June showing 2.0% growth in New Orders and beating estimates of a 0.5% rise. This sizable swing from decline to growth could bode well for earnings.\n\nThere\'s also significance in this morning\'s International Trade report. These figures are less optimistic for earnings, with exports down 2.7% in June after a 3.0% increase in the month prior - such a dip could signal that overall, U.S. firms have recently struggled to break into foreign markets. Companies have generally fared well so far this earnings season, with big names like Microsoft, Johnson & Johnson, IBM, and Visa all beating consensus estimates in the past week and a half. A Fed rate cut will most likely precipitate some volatility in the market, but between now and July 31, three more FAANG stocks ([**Apple Inc  , NASDAQ:AAPL), **Alphabet Inc  **(NASDAQ:GOOG), **Amazon.com, Inc.  **(NASDAQ:AMZN)], **Twitter Inc  **(NYSE:TWTR), **McDonald \'s Inc **(NYSE:MCD), BP, and a slew of other firms will release quarterly data.\n\nThis morning\'s economic data reports, with their conflicting implications, might be telling us that clear skies are no guarantee for earnings in the coming days.\n\n.\n\nImage Sourced by Pixabay\n\nImagine deciding to sit out on an investment that ended up yielding 100,000% returns.\n\nThose five zeros are not typos, and that scenario is no hypothetical: just ask John Doerr, the chairman of the venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins.\n\nDoerr has made many strong investments in his career, including **Alphabet**(NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL), **Amazon.com, Inc.**(NASDAQ:AMZN), **Square Inc**(NASDAQ:SQ) and **Twitter Inc**(NASDAQ:TWTR).\n\nOne of his famous misses came in the mid-2000s, when a young South African on a bold mission gave him a clear proposition to invest in a new kind of technology.\n\nThe South African was Elon Musk, and his new kind of technology was a little something known these days as **Tesla Inc**(NYSE:TSLA).\n\n### Tesla\'s Competing Series C Offers\n\nMusk\'s most famous encounter with encounter with Doerr and Kleiner Perkins occurred during his company\'s push for a Series C investment.\n\nKleiner came in with $50 million; competitor Vantage Point offered $70 million.\n\nDespite Vantage Point\'s 40% higher valuation, Musk explained in a 2012 interview with Sarah Lacy of PandoDaily that he originally leaned toward Kleiner.\n\nMusk\'s personal philosophy is that working with the right people means more than a higher valuation, he said.\n\n"If you have a choice of a lower valuation with someone you really like or a higher valuation with someone you have a question mark about, take the lower valuation," the Tesla CEO said.\n\n"It\'s better to have a higher quality venture capitalist who you think would be great to work than to get a higher valuation with someone where there\'s even a question mark, really."\n\n### Doerr\'s Decision To Sit Out\n\nMusk required a crucial caveat to work with Kleiner: Doerr needed to join the board for the investment.\n\nVantage Point offered more monetarily, but Doerr offered the kind of mind and personality that Musk sought from an investor.\n\nIn the end, Doerr decided to sit out on the opportunity and watch from the sidelines.\n\n"John felt that he had too many obligations and that there was another partner at Kleiner who really wanted the deal, so he could not supplant that person ... I mean, that\'s a 40% difference [in valuation]. I thought if John would be willing to join the board then we could do that, but not if it was somebody else."\n\nThis decision turned out to be a costly one for the entire Kleiner brand, which decided to overlook Tesla in favor of Fisker Automotive, another luxury, energy-saving car company.\n\nSince then, Tesla has soared to a $46 billion market cap valuation.\n\nWith a little math, we can see that Doerr\'s decision to forgo the board seat cost him a 100,000% return on investment.\n\nFisker, on the other hand, declared bankruptcy in late 2013 due to a lack of demand and efficiency.\n\n"That was their mistake," Musk said to a chuckling crowd while discussing the series of events in the same interview with Lacy.\n\n"In the case of Fisker, it was headed by Henrik Fisker, and he\'s the designer," he said. "But he thinks it\'s all about styling, and it\'s not ... the reason we don\'t have electric cars is not for a lack of styling."\n\n### The Fall Of Kleiner\n\nThe Tesla miss turned out to be one of many in a difficult decade for Kleiner Perkins, which also sat on its hands when approached with early opportunities to invest with **Facebook, Inc.** (NASDAQ:FB), **Slack Technologies Inc**(NASDAQ:WORK) and Robinhood.\n\nIt was an even more peculiar misstep for Doerr, who was able to foresee the rise of tech after joining Kleiner in 1980. His plethora of successful ventures sparked Kleiner\'s run to becoming the most recognizable venture capital firm in the U.S. by the mid 2000s.\n\nA plausible explanation for this could have been Doerr\'s dedication to clean energy initiatives. Kleiner invested over $500 million on over 50 clean tech companies in the mid-2000s, most of which did not come to fruition.\n\nAlthough Doerr\'s foresight on the need for clean energy companies was not unmerited, it came too early to cash out and may have blinded Kleiner from juicy opportunities.\n\nThese events, combined with some leadership issues, caused Kleiner, the once gold standard among venture capital firms, to flounder.\n\nDespite strong positions in up-and-coming brands like **Spotify Technology SA**(NYSE:SPOT), **Peloton** and **Intuit Inc.**(NASDAQ:INTU), one can only wonder where Kleiner Perkins and Doerr would be sitting today had they chosen to move forward with that young and bold South African.\n\n_To see Musk \'s full comments with Lacy, skip to the 24-minute mark of the video below._\n\n_Related Links:  _\n\n_Tesla Falls After Q2 Earnings Miss_\n\n_Ahead Of Earnings, Analysts Are Divided On Tesla_\n\nOn CNBC\'s "Options Action," Mike Khouw said **Amazon.com, Inc.** (NASDAQ:AMZN) is implying a 3.9% move when the company reports earnings on Thursday.

 'Convoy CEO Dan Lewis is giving a tour of the company\'s headquarters in downtown Seattle. He points out the stocked kitchens (plural), the 55-person data science team, the P&G Carrier of the Year award and the Ping Pong station, then stops in front of a bulletin board featuring the "Pets of Convoy." There he pulls out his cell phone and displays the Convoy dogs Slack channel - where employees post pictures of office canines - and shows off the "weird emoticons, rainbows and unicorns" his daughters, 8 and 10, like to post under his handle.\n\n"I\'m worried [employees] think that\'s all I\'m doing," mused the affable 38-year old chief of a billion-dollar trucking services company. Actually, nothing could be farther from the truth. "I use email, text - Slack, not so much," Lewis explained. "I just can\'t manage it. I can\'t handle that many channels."\n\nThat a tech CEO is distancing himself from Slack is perhaps a red flag for the newly public workplace messaging platform. Setting aside that concern, Lewis\' attitude is not inconsistent with Convoy\'s mission - to streamline often cumbersome and redundant communications, in this case between shippers and carriers, while raising the bar on all manner of industry practices.\n\nFounded in 2015, Convoy is among the leaders in digital freight-matching, a vanguard class that has upended trucking with apps that allow drivers to book loads instantly via smartphone, circumventing the slow-moving process of having a human being track down the right shipment.\n\nIn a few short years, the company has built a reputation as one of the heftiest disruptors in the trucking app space; the company boasts around 700 employees, added second offices in Atlanta last year, and rocketed to unicorn status courtesy of the $185 million it landed in a Series C round last year. \n\nWith competition coming from all sides - rivals include fellow heavy hitter Uber Freight, legacy brokers and, more recently,******Amazon****.com, Inc.** (NASDAQ:AMZN) - Convoy keeps a tight lid on its size and financials. The team claims "tens of thousands of carriers" on its network, hundreds of shipments per week in major markets and a nationwide roster of shippers from Fortune 500 companies, yet steadfastly refuses to reveal margins, revenues and the actual number of customers.\n\nProprietary shields notwithstanding, a visit to the Seattle headquarters this summer did provide a glimpse of Convoy operations, corporate culture and how a tech-driven enterprise is trying to focus as much on people and businesses as it does on algorithms and data science.\n\n"Trucking is a very underappreciated space - it\'s the background noise of America," said Lewis, sitting in a small light-filled conference room that overlooks the Pike Place Market and Puget Sound, the water dotted with ferries.\n\n"It\'s so easy to not appreciate all that goes into the comfortable lifestyle we have, the BS that truck drivers put up with and the difficulty of running their businesses. I really enjoy knowing that if we do this really well, we can give drivers more control over their business, help them make more money and bring more respect and trust to the industry."\n\nThe son of an English as a Second Language teacher, Lewis worked at his father\'s and uncle\'s office supply company delivering furniture, boxes and pallets of paper. Describing the company\'s growth trajectory, he said he "definitely view[s] Convoy as part of a story-line," with the startup seeking to define itself in an industry "that is also going through this journey, being defined and discovered as we go." \n\n"A big part of how we\'re able to be innovative is to make sure everyone feels part of the story," continued Lewis, who left his position as Amazon\'s general manager of shopping services to co-found Convoy with CTO Grant Goodale, who also worked for the e-commerce giant. "Everyone should be thinking about what is that next big thing."\n\nIn today\'s frenetic package delivery environment, where next-day and even same day shipping is becoming the norm, Convoy\'s next big things increasingly move beyond automated bookings to include a broader suite of trucking technology services that address "these really tricky problems that live at the intersection of human behavior and data science," as Convoy chief product officer Ziad Ismail puts it.\n\nWhether it\'s unlocking capacity, speeding up driver payments or making trucking safer and cleaner, the solution "is not just a pure formula," explained Ismail, a native Swede and former CPO of Marchex who met Lewis 10 years ago when both were working on the same team at Microsoft. "It\'s, how do you get people to feel comfortable and have a better experience?" \n\nThe extent to which industry players - shippers, brokers and truckers - still favor the human relationships that for decades defined the way freight companies do business is one of the debates surrounding around the new algorithm-driven disruptors.\n\nConvoy plays both sides. The company made a big splash last winter with the announcement that it had succeeded in matching 100 percent of loads automatically in major markets (95 percent nationwide), effectively eliminating the need for any person to call or communicate between the shipper and carrier. Its latest solution is an automated reloads feature, assisting drivers who use the Convoy app to ensure that they have a load outbound when they accept an inbound load.\n\nBut the team is also tapping into physical assets - the Convoy Go product utilizes a leased Convoy trailer pool and allows owner-operators and small fleets to take advantage of power-only loads.\n\nIn May, Convoy introduced the Innovation Lab, an incubator in which shippers work with engineers and data scientists in solving a pain point. And AaronTerraza, Zillow\'s former head of economics research, recently signed on as Convoy director of economic research, providing industry commentary and analysis.\n\n"We didn\'t view this as, \'let\'s completely remove people from the system,\'" said Lewis. "We viewed it as, \'how do we deliver the best experience for our customer end-to-end?\' In some cases we get cost and quality improvements by choosing to automate. And in some cases the circumstances are such that a person is definitely the best thing to apply to the problem."\n\nContrary to popular opinion, Convoy brokers do work the phones, said vice president of operations Kristen Forecki, with some team members "responding all day to questions they might get from a carrier."\n\nA former director of customer experience at the dog care marketplace Rover.com, Forecki started working at Convoy when the startup employed only 20 people. "The most exciting thing about what Convoy is doing," she said, "is how we are influencing industry to work the way it should and help it work in a way that results in a better experience for everyone." She cited as an example the automated detention product, a feature she says was picked up by other industry players after it had been introduced by Convoy.\n\nConvoy certainly has grand ambitions. Like many of today\'s tech startups, the company takes pains to position itself as a "solutions" business, one that doesn\'t automate for the sake of automation but uses tech as a tool to transform businesses, industry and ultimately, the society in which both are embedded. "Transport the world with endless capacity and zero waste," the Convoy motto proclaims.\n\nAspirational messaging aside, the company\'s diversification strategy reflects market realities as the new industry continues to define and redefine itself.\n\nNumerous studies show the on-demand trucking platforms, fueled by hundreds of millions of dollars in venture capital, are not only gaining traction but are changing the way shippers, carriers and brokers operate. The notoriety - some say hype - surrounding the likes of Convoy, Uber Freight and others has raised awareness in the marketplace, and truckers, like everyone else, are far more tech-savvy today than they used to be.\n\nYet to be determined, however, is whether Convoy and others will take market share from their legacy counterparts in the same way, say, ride-sharing companies took market share from taxis (and buses).\n\n"This whole digital brokerage has the potential to be disruptive, but I don\'t think that\'s happened yet," said Ron Scalzo, senior managing director with FTI Consulting. "There\'s a lot of downloading of apps, but that doesn\'t necessarily translate into taking business away from large brokerages."\n\nAccording to a study released last spring by UBS Group AG, more than 40 percent of the trucker app download market share comes from apps introduced by the big brokers and load boards such as J.B. Hunt\'s Carrier 360 and DAT\'s Load Board. Uber Freight (capitalizing on name recognition) has 23 percent of the trucking app download market share, according to the study, while Convoy has 9 percent.\n\nAdding to the increasingly crowded space are mega-players like Amazon; the Seattle-based online retailer announced it was building a freight brokerage earlier this year. Oracle is also moving into the space specifically targeting shippers that are already on its platform.\n\nUnfazed by the competition, the Convoy team says the trucking industry is large enough - there are more than 500,000 trucking companies in the U.S., 80 percent of which are small businesses - to accommodate more than one winner in the digital solutions market. Convoy spends "zero percent of the time" thinking about rivals, said Ismail, and instead focuses exclusively on its customers.\n\nMaybe he\'s naive, Lewis said, but he doesn\'t view Amazon as a threat. The e-giant, he said, is too focused on the retail customer.\n\nThe upstart brokerages face other challenges. The trucking industry is not only huge - it\'s also hugely fragmented, and that fragmentation has been a pain point for decades, complicating efforts for shippers to find truck drivers and making it more difficult for smaller trucking outfits in particular to access loads.\n\nIdeally, digital freight-matching platforms bridge the gaps and level the playing field - all the trucks go into the same database, and the system selects the best option. Their success, however, hinges on an important data point - the number of shippers and carriers on the network. Like any exchange, a critical mass of buyers and sellers are necessary for a freight marketplace to work the way it\'s supposed to. "It is about density in terms of the loads that are put on the app," said Scalzo. "There should be some ratio of loads to drivers that needs to scale."\n\nConvoy is devoting significant time and energy to this issue, Lewis said. "We have done a lot of work with our data science team to figure out how much volume we need to be doing under specific circumstances so that we then see the payoff in the sense of a very tightly knit technology-adopted community of truck drivers, which improves service costs."\n\nBut he declined to reveal exactly what the "right size" of the network might be, saying only, "we kind of know what that number is."\n\nAnecdotal reports suggest most carriers use multiple freight-matching apps. Jimmy Nevarez, an owner-operator in Chino, California, uses five or six platforms to manage loads he acquires through the spot market - the short-notice shipments that fluctuate in price based supply and demand.\n\nConvoy refreshes loads quickly, offers quick digital payment and allows drivers to bid higher than the asking rate - "that\'s contrary to Uber," he said, "where it\'s \'take it or leave it.\'" On the downside, the rates on the different platforms vary, and it\'s cumbersome "to flip and flop between different apps," Nevarez said, adding that it\'s a necessary evil as "they all carry different freight from different customers."\n\nOccupying three floors in Seattle\'s Century Square building, the Convoy offices hum with energy. The inevitable rows of computer workstations contrast with homages to trucking\'s past and present, from the conference rooms with names derived from industry - "Hot Shot," "Lowboy" and "Kingpin" - to the poster of  Convoy, the "super cheesy" (Lewis\' descriptor) 1978 movie after which the company is named. For a time, Lewis said, the startup used to play the title song after each company meeting.\n\nA peculiarity of the building\'s design is that the exterior windows resemble those gracing the Washington State Ferries; along with the views of Puget Sound and some strategically placed blue furniture, the offices convey the feeling of being on a very large boat, adding another shipping element to the Convoy enterprise. (Citing proprietary information, the company did not allow this reporter to take any photos of the actual office space; a product meeting FreightWaves attended was off the record.)\n\nAs Convoy grows - the company counts 78 job openings as of this week - maintaining the energy and intensity of a startup gets more difficult, Lewis said. "One of our mottoes is: \'How do we stay smaller as we get bigger?\'" he said.\n\nHome to two of the biggest tech companies in the world - Microsoft and Amazon - but comparably few startups, Seattle offers Convoy access to some of the country\'s best-in-class tech talent. The hiring advantages come at a cost of limited and expensive real estate, deficiencies that Lewis said the office in Atlanta helps correct.\n\nIsmail singled out several key ingredients that help keep decision-making from becoming "muddled" as the company gets bigger. Convoy encourages people "not to drive toward consensus," he said, because "if they disagree, there is something interesting to uncover." \n\nPods are another feature of the Convoy landscape. These are sub-teams that include employees from different divisions - data science, engineers, product managers, marketing - and operate as an autonomous startup within a startup. "Mixing all these disciplines in an entrepreneurial way has given us our very best innovations," said Ismail.\n\nThe team alluded to future plans. It took two-and-a-half years for one pod to achieve the 100 percent matching milestone, Ismail said. Automating pricing is the next big mountain to climb. "People say it can\'t be done. That motivates the team." \n\nConvoy probably will raise more money in the future, Lewis said, but declined to specify further. Global expansion is another important part of the company\'s next phase, he said, again declining to comment on specifics. (Uber Freight expanded to the Netherlands in May and earlier this month announced its launch in Germany.)\n\nAs he juggles investment, expansion and the next big freight-matching solution, Lewis tries not to lose sight of the bigger picture.\n\n"If I ignored all metrics for my company, and if all I focused on was making our country better, making people\'s lives better, reducing waste, reducing fuel emissions, reducing congestion, lowering cost - if that\'s all we measured and did those things successfully, we\'d have an incredibly successful business," Lewis said.\n\nBefore he signed on with Convoy, Ismail wasn\'t interested in the trucking or automotive space. He laughed. "Now, I\'m like: \'that\'s the power unit.\'"\n\nIsmail continued, "You drive, and you think about statistics, about how much wasted time and fuel and environmental impact. It\'s very clear why it\'s happening - we need trucks, and of course there\'s going to be emissions and pollution. "\n\nHe added, "But once you get deeper into the industry, you see you have something like the traveling salesman problem - millions of different combinations of lanes, fragmented across 15,000 brokers - and that part of the reason we have all that waste is it\'s a human trying to solve what is fundamentally a computer science problem."\n\nIn conclusion, Ismail said, "Trucking has been around for 100 years, but it\'s clear in the past three, four, five years that there\'s a new trucking industry that starting to take shape."\n\nImage Sourced by Pixabay\n\nThe Fortnite World Cup Solo finals ended Sunday, with player Kyle "Bugha" Giersdorf, 16, taking home the first-place prize of $3 million, according to Kotaku. \n\nGiersdorf went wire-to-wire to win the first event of its kind, held at New York\'s Arthur Ashe Stadium.

The Micro E-mini Nasdaq-100 fell right alongside it, as well as both Amazon and Alphabet, given their high correlations to one another. **Alphabet Inc  **(NASDAQ:GOOG) shares soared more than 9% in post-market trade following a quarterly report that beat on the top and bottom lines while **Amazon.com, Inc.  **(NASDAQ:AMZN) was off 1.5% as profit missed consensus. The Micro E-mini Nasdaq-100 rallied on the positive report from Alphabet (See Figure 1).\n\n**FIGURE 1: COMPARISON CHART.** Comparison chart of /MNQ and GOOGL highlighting moves when GOOGL reported earnings on July 25, 2019.

Past performance does not guarantee future results._\n\n**Apple Inc  **(NASDAQ:AAPL), one of the most widely traded stocks at TD Ameritrade and the second largest Nasdaq-100 company, reports Q3 results on July 30, 2019, after market close. Keep an eye on how the Micro E-mini Nasdaq-100 contract responds to the earnings release as it has historically caused rocky oscillations in the index. The Micro E-mini Nasdaq-100 contract also allows investors to effectively hedge a portfolio of heavily weighted technology companies. This offers the potential to minimize risk during earnings season while only using a relatively small amount of capital. The smaller size contract may potentially create opportunities for investors or traders with smaller portfolios or provide granularity in hedging a larger one. \n\nAvailable virtually 24 hours a day, 6 days a week, the Micro E-mini Nasdaq-100 has ample liquidity around the clock which is especially useful as most companies release their earnings before or after U.S. equity market hours.\n\nWatch this short video on Micro E-mini Future Contracts to learn more:\n\n_Information from TDA is not intended to be investment advice or construed as a recommendation or endorsement of any particular investment or investment strategy, and is for illustrative purposes only.

As such, investors may want to consider waiting for a better opportunity to buy the "large, improving cash flow machine" of a company.\n\n### The Analyst\n\nStifel\'s David Ross downgraded UPS from Buy to Hold with an unchanged $118 price target.\n\n### The Thesis\n\nUPS reported its second-quarter results last week, which showed a 7% growth in U.S. daily volume activity while a main concern was partly debunked, Ross wrote in the note. Specifically, expectations for **Amazon.com, Inc.** (NASDAQ:AMZN) to lower its dependency on UPS and other delivery partners in favor of its own network is not playing out as Amazon is adding to UPS\'s network density.\n\nAmazon could in theory transition from a customer to a rival, but Ross said there is little sign of this happening over the next few years.\n\nMeanwhile, Ross said UPS\'s 747-8 jets and 767 freighters are likely to come online in the next few years as part of the company\'s investments to support growing e-commerce activity. This should help UPS sustain its market leading advantage moving forward although at the expense of limiting margin and earnings expansion for the next year at least.\n\n### Price Action\n\nShares of UPS were trading lower by 1.7% at $118.48 Monday afternoon.\n\n_Related Links:_\n\n_FedEx Move To 7-Day Ground Delivery Will Have Costs Before Revenue Gains_\n\n_KeyBanc: UPS Set To Deliver With Investment Benefits, International Growth Potential_'
 'After the success of the Fortnite World Cup Finals in New York over the weekend, D.A. Davidson said the battle royale game franchise is "alive and well.\n\nThe event is a positive data point for the emergence of esports, analyst Tom Forte said in a Monday note. \n\nThe analyst said he recommends investors purchase shares of Turtle Beach Corp****(NASDAQ:HEAR), **Logitech International SA** (NASDAQ:LOGI) and **Amazon.com, Inc.**(NASDAQ:AMZN) as plays on the sector. \n\nThe Fortnite World Cup solidifies the view that esports represents a secular shift and is a global phenomenon, not a fad, Forte said.\n\nThe "Fortnite" franchise is durable and has secured a place in a growing esports universe, he said. \n\nKyle "Bugha" Giersdorf took home the singles division championship and the $3-million prize at the tournament.\n\nOverall, Epic Games offered $30 million in prize money at the Fortnite World Cup Finals. \n\n_Related Links:_\n\n_Who Profits From The Incredible Success Of\'Fortnite\'?_\n\n_GameStop Continues To Suffer After Mixed Q1 Report, Eliminating Dividend_\n\nE-commerce retailer **eBay Inc  **(NASDAQ:EBAY) announced on July 24 that it would launch an end-to-end fulfillment service called Managed Delivery in 2020. The move is intended to drive uniformity and improvements in service levels across eBay\'s network of third-party sellers and bring it into closer competition with **Amazon.com, Inc.  **(NASDAQ:AMZN), which has made short transit times and low-cost delivery a key differentiator.\n\nUnlike Amazon, though, eBay will partner with a number of third-party logistics providers (3PLs) on transportation, warehousing and packaging services. While Amazon has decided to in-source transportation and logistics - the point of investing more than $800 million on next-day Prime delivery - eBay is betting that outsourcing will be a faster and more capital-efficient way to scale.\n\nJason Lockard, senior vice president for enterprise at BlueGrace Logistics, a Tampa-based freight brokerage, spoke to FreightWaves by telephone about the recent entry by e-commerce companies into transportation markets. \n\nLockard said that eBay was trying to gain more visibility into and control over its inventory and supply chain so that it could improve service.\n\n"The more control eBay has over the inventory and the supply chain, the more it can meet the demands of its customers," Lockard said. "The bar has been set higher as it relates to being able to select something online and receive it at the front door without damage or exception."\n\nAmazon has built an extensive network of distribution and fulfillment centers as well as the transportation assets needed to move goods between the facilities. In April, FreightWaves reported on Amazon\'s digital brokerage platform and then conducted further research on how shippers, carriers and brokers reacted to the news. FreightWaves found that shippers viewed Amazon\'s digital brokerage platform perhaps less negatively than they should; after all, they have the most to lose by giving Amazon access to their supply chain data.\n\nLockard suggested that less sophisticated shippers focused on sales growth without worrying about giving up control to their most powerful competitor. \n\n"Non-savvy shippers just see demand and sales increasing," Lockard said. "They don\'t have buying power for carriers, and they start having exceptions and other issues. Amazon takes care of issues very quickly, putting it back on the suppliers."\n\nOne of BlueGrace\'s most important offerings to shippers trying to take advantage of e-commerce distribution channels is its proprietary load-planning technology, BlueShip. While BlueGrace\'s core competence is domestic truckload and less-than-truckload freight brokerage, the company found that many of its customers needed help upstream to streamline their broad supply chain operations and increase efficiency.\n\n"You\'ve got to get creative to keep costs down and meet the expectations of the customer," Lockard said. "Upstream it\'s the expectations of the distribution center and the manufacturing facility to the distribution center, all the way up to raw materials planning."\n\nRather than BlueGrace\'s customers sending it shipment-level execution information, Lockard explained, the shippers pass along their orders and data about on-time and in-full requirements and desired delivery dates instead. Then BlueGrace creates a load plan and tells its customers how to build the shipments and when to move the freight, and the shipper works backwards from that.\n\n"Too often shippers are trying to solve a warehouse or supply chain issue with a transportation solution," Lockard said. "It\'s very difficult to fix something at the end of the process," he said, noting that faster information flows and streamlined upstream operations can take much of the pressure off of transportation providers.\n\nAfter a very tight cycle when BlueGrace was trying to maintain service levels and keep its customers happy, Lockard said that capacity has opened back up. Over the past year, national tender rejections (OTRI.USA) have fallen from about 19 percent of all loads tendered by shippers to 4.2 percent, indicating that carriers have fewer options when it comes to selecting freight. Average spot prices (DATVF.VNU) have fallen alongside turndowns, from approximately $1.80/mile to $1.40/mile. \n\nNow carriers are more willing to negotiate rates down and BlueGrace can re-establish some margin. It\'s also a period when BlueGrace can use a bit of breathing room to re-evaluate its own processes and technology and improve how its brokers work.\n\n"Anything that\'s manual today is being evaluated," Lockard said.\n\nImage sourced from Google'
 'Nov. 22, 2017 started as a relatively uneventful day for Yvonne Shore.\n\nShe went to her job -- "the best job ever" -- as a car dealership auditor in Atlanta.\n\nBut for Shore, 70, the past few months had not been normal. She had been having a hard time breathing -- deep breaths especially.\n\nThough she\'d led an active life -- having once jet skied across the U.S. -- she was finding herself out of breath faster than usual. She would work one day and have to take off the next.\n\nFrustrated, Shore went to her doctor. She wasn\'t exactly expecting good news, but she had know way of knowing just how bad the news would be.\n\nUp until this point, Shore had led "the most beautiful life."\n\nOriginally from Madison, Wisconsin, she spent most of her career as an executive secretary. Even the periods of turmoil seemed to work themselves out. It was the death of her mother and end of her first marriage in quick succession that prompted her cross-country jet ski excursion, which led to her resettling in Atlanta, and in turn her second marriage.\n\nOn Jan. 26, 2018, she learned she had chronic bronchitis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and emphysema. Shore was told she was unlikely to live past Christmas.\n\n### \'A Miracle Treatment\' -- But At A Cost\n\nAccording to the American Lung Association, 11 million people have been diagnosed with COPD and 3.1 million with emphysema, though many more could be living unknowingly with the diseases.\n\nThe Center for Disease Control estimates that 8.6 million people have chronic bronchitis.\n\nThough they can be treated with inhalers, antibiotics, steroids or a lung transplant in severe cases, no known cures exist for emphysema or chronic bronchitis, which can lead to COPD.\n\nCOPD is the third leading cause of death in the United States, according to the ALA.\n\nShore said she tried inhalers and medications, but none were helping. That was when she heard about an experimental stem cell therapy treatment at the Nashville Lung Institute.\n\nThe problem: Shore needed $12,000 just to walk in the door, and it wouldn\'t be covered by insurance.\n\nShe found a possible solution online.\n\n"I had always wanted to learn the stock market and to trade," Shore said.\n\n### Trading Like Her Life Depended On It\n\nAfter signing up for a few online classes and joining several communities, Shore finally explained her situation to one mentor who went by Joe Stocks.\n\n"I went back to my teacher and I said \'here\'s the deal. I\'m dying and I want to live. And I need $12,000 in a matter of two to three weeks. Can you help me?\'"\n\nThe mentor asked how much Shore had on hand; the answer was about $2,500.\n\n"And he said \'perfect.\' And we did. Under his tutelage I made $41,000 in 17 days."\n\nShore said her main strategy is scalping, or looking for repeatable opportunities where she can make quick profits in a small group of stocks. In doing so, she has gotten to know **Bank of America Corp** (NYSE:BAC) -- which she said she trades every day -- and routinely trades **Netflix Inc** (NASDAQ:NFLX), **Alphabet Inc.**(NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL), **Amazon.com, Inc.** (NASDAQ:AMZN) and other blue-chip stocks.\n\nShore said she was not afraid of trading because she was desperate to find a way to pay her medical expenses.\n\n"Sort of like my jet skis, I just hopped right on and went and I raced. I guess I did the same thing with the stock market because I needed money and I knew it was going to be an easy way to make money, or so I thought. And it worked out very nicely for me."\n\nAfter getting more comfortable with trading, Shore eventually transitioned to options, which is her preferred instrument today.\n\n"Options keep me pretty well occupied," Shore said. "I like the up and down. I like the quickness of it. I like the instant gratification right away in the morning that I\'ve made anywhere from $50 to $500 in a few minutes."\n\n  \n_Shore and trading friends Jean Kramb and Whit Russell discussing stocks and options._\n\n### Lessons Learned\n\nShore said her biggest wins and losses were both around $8,000. And though she hasn\'t been as consistently successful as in that initial period, she said she has done well enough to continue to afford treatment.\n\n"In order to win, you have to lose," Shore said.\n\n"That\'s the best lesson of all. It teaches you. Even though you lost money, you feel really good about it because you know what your error was and you try not to make that error again."\n\nThe trading education space can be tricky for novices to navigate.\n\nThe best trading groups will give users a free trial to see whether they like the course or not, Shore said; this is what helped her find one of her current groups, XTrades.\n\nShore also cited Positive Trends, Perspective Trading, Real Life Trading and Benzinga\'s PreMarket Prep as online communities she\'s learned from.\n\n  \n_Shore, far right, with her daughter Robyn Steckel, far left, Jerremy Newsome of Real Life Trading and his fiance Ashley Allen. Shore met Newsome while receiving treatment in Nashville._\n\nShe also suggests searching on YouTube to help judge whether a group is legitimate or not.\n\n"I\'ve always had a good sense about me and whether I think I should do something or not," Shore said.\n\n"I just knew from the moment I started that particular class that I liked it. If you find a class or a group that you like, I would suggest going to YouTube and listening to them."\n\n### What Does This Say About The State Of Health Care?\n\n  \n_Shore, Steckel and her nurses at the Nashville Lung Institute._\n\nStem cell therapy has a complicated legislative history that currently doesn\'t allow insurance companies to cover the treatment.\n\nShore\'s need to find alternative ways to pay for her therapy shows the American healthcare system is in disarray, Shore said.\n\n"It sucks," Shore said of the U.S. health care system.\n\n"There are so many people that could still be here with us [if] our government could allow stem cell treatments for everybody at a reduced rate so everybody could afford it. Our country would be much better off."\n\nSince the diagnosis, Shore\'s health varies day-by-day. Weather changes can disrupt her breathing, and it\'s difficult for her to get around.\n\nThough the stem cell treatments are helping, the advanced nature of Shore\'s diagnosis means the best she can hope for is to maintain her current quality of life a little while longer.\n\n"I see the results," Shore said.\n\nShe previously used an inhaler 14 times a day and is down to two. Shore was on oxygen 24/7 and is now using it for a few hours every six or seven days. \n\n"That is how much it has helped me."\n\nShe plans to keep on trading as long as she can.\n\n"I was supposed to pass last Christmas, and I\'m still here."\n\n_Shore will be a featured guest on Thursday \'s Premarket Prep Show at 8:35 a.m. EST.

Oversupply of shale gas has led to a fall in prices, with the industry uncertain on when the prices will get back up. Add to this the fact that drilling companies had downplayed their increasingly morbid financial situation, and the industry has conditions that mirror a perfect recipe for trouble. \n\nAll these years, the fracking companies have been taking investor money by selling them the dream of a massive production potential in the Permian Basin and convincing them about easy breakeven possibilities - even when there was not enough evidence to back that claim. With the promises not translating on the ground, investors are looking to cut back on their spending in the segment. During this quarter\'s earnings reports, large shale oil companies have expressed frustration at the series of problems arising in their operations and with the downturn in prices. \n\n**Did you know?**\n\nInvestment in the U.K. car industry has suffered a decline ahead of Brexit, with it falling to £90 million in the first six months of the year from £347 million last year. Manufacturing fell by one-fifth during the time, with 666,521 cars coming off the production lines, compared to 834,573 cars during the same period in 2018. \n\n**Quotable**\n\n"In trade negotiations, nothing is decided until everything is decided, although it\'s possible there will be some baby steps, some partial landing zones, to build confidence." \n\n_- __James Green, a former U.S. diplomat and trade official, commenting on the U.S.-China trade tariff talks_\n\n**In other news**\n\n**Buyers resist the move to new tech**\n\nCar makers are spending billions of dollars every year developing this new technology but it appears that buyers simply don\'t want it.

(Entrepreneur)\n\n**Final Thoughts**\n\n**Amazon.com, Inc.** (NASDAQ:AMZN) is betting big time on India, looking to enter the country\'s on-demand food delivery market by buying the Indian operations of Uber Eats. Today, several startups - Zomato, Foodpanda, Swiggy and Uber Eats - wrestle for market dominance in India, with Swiggy leading the race by delivering 800,000 orders per day. Though Uber Eats India has been burning through a lot of cash in recent years, it has nothing much to show in terms of market capitalization, as it only delivers around 150,000 to 200,000 orders per day. Amazon, which is eager to expand its last-mile distribution network, will look to learn lessons from food delivery operations and channel them into its Amazon Prime one-day delivery operations. \n\nHammer down everyone!\n\nImage Sourced From Pixabay\n\nShares of **Apple Inc.** (NASDAQ:AAPL) gained 4% after reporting encouraging fiscal third-quarter results. The iPhone maker reported a top- and bottom-line beat and Services revenue hit a record higher. Several Apple experts weighed in after the report.\n\n### Ecosystem Strength\n\nThe main takeaway from Apple\'s report is the strength of its ecosystem, Alison Porter, a Portfolio Manager at Janus Henderson Investors, told CNBC. Apple managed to show a 12% decline in iPhone revenue compared to the same quarter last year, yet total revenue rose year-over-year.\n\n"It\'s a whole ecosystem [story]," she said. "It\'s [iPhone] Max, it\'s iPads, it\'s moving into enterprise, it\'s in services. It\'s about the whole Apple ecosystem."\n\n### \'Cash Machine\'\n\nExiting Apple\'s earnings print, it\'s evident the company is a "cash machine," Loup Ventures\'s Gene Munster said on CNBC. Apple generated twice as much cash in the quarter as **Amazon.com, Inc.** (NASDAQ:AMZN) and **Facebook, Inc.** (NASDAQ:FB) did combined in the June-ending quarter.\n\n"The bigger picture here is this story that I think gets largely missed by the Street," he said.\n\n### New Business Model Needed\n\nApple\'s recent product launches is defined as incremental improvements instead of revolutionary, professor at IMD Business School Howard Yu told CNBC. The two most recent examples include the launch of an Apple-branded credit card still tied to the iPhone and the acquisition of **Intel Corporation** (NASDAQ:INTC)\'s modem business is to help launch a 5G phone.\n\n"What Apple needs is to branch out a new business model -- much like Amazon going from B2C to B2B providing cloud based services," he said.\n\nApple\'s stock traded around $217 per share at time of publication.\n\n_Related Links:_\n\n_Mike Khouw Sees Unusual Options Activity In Apple_\n\n_Intel Beats Earnings Estimates, Confirms $1B Deal With Apple_']
