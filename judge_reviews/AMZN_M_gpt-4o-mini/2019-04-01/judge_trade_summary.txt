Based on the provided market data and news, predict the LLM’s decision:
News Factors Considered:
['Retail sales data is starting to concern some market observers, but some exchange traded funds still offer upside potential.\n\n"Total sales for the November 2018 through January 2019 period were up 2.6 percent (±0.5 percent) from the same period a year ago," according to a Census Bureau report published last week. "The November 2018 to December 2018 percent change was revised from down 1.2 percent (±0.5 percent) to down 1.6 percent (±0.3 percent)."\n\n### What To Know\n\nAs has been widely noted, e-commerce and online shopping are the future of retail sales. Today, e-commerce represents about 10 percent of U.S. retail sales, indicating there\'s plenty of room for growth. Growth that\'s expected to come at the expense of traditional brick-and-mortar retailers.\n\nInvestors can tap both trends under the umbrella of one ETF with the **ProShares Long Online/Short Stores ETF** (NYSE:CLIX). With a gain of 1.18 percent last Friday, CLIX hit an all-time high and is up nearly 25 percent this year.\n\n### Why It\'s Important\n\nCLIX, which debuted in November 2017, follows the ProShares Long Online/Short Stores Index, offering a long/short approach that is unique to retail investing.\n\n"CLIX combines a 100% long position in retailers that primarily sell online or through other non-store channels with a 50% short position in those that rely principally on physical stores," according to Maryland-based ProShares. "Investors have the opportunity to benefit from both outperforming online and underperforming physical retailers. The long/short structure also reduces equity market exposure and potentially results in less volatility than long-only equity strategies."\n\nThe long holdings in CLIX must be classified as e-commerce, Internet direct marketing retailers or online retailers while the fund\'s short components must derive at least 75 percent of their sales from physical stores.\n\nThere are 21 longs and 56 shorts in CLIX\'s underlying index.\n\n### What\'s Next\n\nThe long side of the CLIX portfolio is dominated by two stocks and those names are not surprising. **Amazon.com Inc.**(NASDAQ:AMZN), the largest domestic e-commerce company; and **Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.** (NYSE:BABA), China\'s largest e-commerce company; combine for almost 40 percent of the CLIX lineup.\n\nThe fund charges 0.65 percent per year, which is favorable among long/short strategies.\n\n_Related Links_\n\n_A Really Cheap New ETF_\n\n_A 5G Conversion For This ETF_'
 '**Amazon.com, Inc.** (NASDAQ:AMZN) is off to another hot start to 2019, and one analyst said Tuesday Amazon Business is a long-term growth driver that\'s really starting to pick up steam.\n\n### The Analyst\n\nBank of America analyst Justin Post reiterated his Buy rating and $2,100 price target for Amazon.\n\n### The Thesis\n\nAs Amazon\'s e-commerce business matures, the company\'s next major shot in the arm could come from business-to-business sales.\n\nAmazon Business was launched as Amazon Supply back in 2012. In the past two years alone, Amazon Business\' gross merchandise volume (GMV) run rate has grown from $1 billion to $10 billion, according to Post. He said momentum should continue throughout the next decade.\n\n"Globally, the 2021 B2B eCommerce TAM is estimated at $6.7tn and, excluding the Chinese B2B market at an estimated 60% of total, we project a \'21 international B2B online TAM of $2.1tn," Post wrote in a note.\n\nPost said margins may be a challenge, but the potential impact of Amazon expanding its Business reach could have a huge impact on the stock\'s long-term valuation.\n\nPost estimates Amazon Business GMV will more than triple from here to $34 billion by 2023. Amazon Business already has more than one million customers. But if Amazon gains just 5 percent international market share and 10 percent U.S. market share, Post estimates Amazon Business could contribute an additional $125 billion to $245 billion in value over time.\n\n### Price Action\n\nAmazon\'s stock traded higher by 2 percent to $1,777 per share at time of publication.\n\n_Related Links:_\n\n_Do You Love Cult Stocks? _\n\n_Barclays Analyst Says Tesla Is No Apple_\n\n**Amazon.com, Inc.** (NASDAQ:AMZN) said late Monday that it has rolled out a day-definite delivery service to its Business Prime members under which a business customer can designate one recurring day per week to receive all of its deliveries.\n\nThe service, called "Amazon Day for Business," follows the launch several weeks ago of "Amazon Day" for Amazon\'s residential customers. Amazon touts the model as a way for customers to better plan their schedules by having their weekly purchases grouped and delivered at one time rather than being spread out over multiple days and truck trips. The model also reduces truck trips and packaging, according to the company.\n\nAmazon\'s delivery business is overwhelmingly residential, so its business delivery segment gets scant attention. The Business segment generated about $10 billion in annual sales in 2018 for the Seattle-based e-tailer, a fraction of its $233 billion in overall sales in 2018. The Business service currently operates in eight countries.\n\nAs with the more familiar Amazon Prime service, Business Prime members receive unlimited two-day delivery on more than 100 million items on Amazon\'s site. Users who purchase the service at tiers above the basic level receive "spend visibility tools" to monitor purchasing patterns, and a "guided buying" feature that the company said creates "policy rules (that) guide employees to approved products and help prevent procurement violations."\n\nWant more content like this?

They included an amendment by which the United States would stay in the UPU as long as it - and other countries - were allowed to self-declare "terminal dues," the rates traditionally determined by the UPU to be paid by the postal operator in the origin country to that of the destination country to compensate the destination country\'s processing and delivery costs.\n\nAccording to Bloomberg, the proposal was discussed on March 14 at a U.S. State Department committee meeting led by Joseph Murphy, head of the department\'s International Postal Affairs group. Murphy advised the committee, Bloomberg noted, that so far about 30 member countries support the U.S. proposal - which would require a two-thirds vote of membership to approve - with a similar number supporting another option that would speed rate increases that the UPU has already approved.\n\n"I think that provides a reasonable assessment of the situation at this moment in time," David Dadge, a spokesman for the UPU, told FreightWaves. "Of course, we very much hope that the U.S. will remain a member of the Universal Postal Union. But as a UN Specialized Agency we also have to forge a consensus among all our 192 member countries."\n\nThe withdrawal notice in October 2018 followed a memorandum issued by President Trump in August 2018 calling for the UPU reforms. While the UPU\'s main objective is to lower the cost of shipping small packages worldwide for consumers in all countries, the Trump Administration\'s real target is China, which has benefitted from a stipulation in the UPU treaty assigning lower shipping rates to developing countries. The consensus is that the U.S. is using changes at the UPU as a substitute for Chinese tariffs.\n\nAs FreightWaves previously reported, Peter Navarro, who directs the White House Office of Trade and Manufacturing Policy, wrote in an op-ed in September 2018 that the U.S. Postal Service loses about $1 for every small package that arrives from China but American goods exported are charged above cost, making some of those products less cost-competitive in the global market. He also said President Trump would consider self-declared rates for shipping to the U.S. if there was no progress in negotiating a compromise with the UPU.\n\nThe State Department acknowledged it would prefer that the U.S. remain a member of the UPU, and that it is working with the organization and other member states to put in place the reforms that meet President Trump\'s concerns.\n\n"We are actively negotiating one option that would achieve the Administration\'s objectives of self-declared rates and non-distorted markets," a State Department spokesperson confirmed to FreightWaves. "If successful, these reforms will allow the United States to rescind its withdrawal notice and remain a member of the UPU."\n\nWant more content like this?

The research firm also noted partnerships with telcos that could use the RTX Pod to stream games over 5G.\n\n### The Price Action\n\nNvidia shares were advancing 3.88 percent to $175.51 at the time of publication Tuesday. \n\n_Related Link: What\'s Next For Nvidia And Mellanox? _\n\n_Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang at the GPU Technology Conference. Photo courtesy of Nvidia.  _\n\nThere have been two major themes arguably helping to boost stocks this year: A dovish Fed and increasing optimism about a U.S.-China trade deal.\n\nWith little news on the latter front this morning, focus could turn toward the Fed, which begins its two-day policy meeting today. With the central bank widely expected to hold rates steady this week, that leaves Fed watchers to anticipate whether policy makers will telegraph more thinking on a potential rate trajectory with a change to its dot plot. \n\nAnother thing the market seems likely to watch for is any new insight into the Fed\'s balance sheet plans, as a slowdown or halt to its bond reduction program could be one way for the Fed to try to give the economy a lift without taking the more dramatic step of lowering rates. The meeting concludes tomorrow, followed by a press conference from Fed Chair Jerome Powell.\n\nStocks appeared ready to resume rallying early Tuesday, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average ($DJI) going for a five-day winning streak even with the fact that **Boeing Co  **(NYSE:BA) has shaved about 400 points off the $DJI since the company\'s troubles started last week. BA shares were down just a touch in pre-market trading.\n\n### Between Brexit and Beijing\n\nOn the other front that the market has been closely watching, media reports suggest that a summit between President Trump and President Xi of China might not happen until June, but that news didn\'t appear to have much of a negative impact Monday. Maybe as long as the two sides are talking and tariffs aren\'t moving higher, some investors might be willing to forgive delays. \n\nMarkets in Asia were mostly lower early Tuesday in slow trading.\n\nIn other overseas news, the Brexit situation might be worth keeping an eye for its potential effects on European markets and the euro\'s relationship to the dollar as more news potentially comes down the pike. The latest reports make it look like there might be a long delay in Brexit. They\'re going to play the stall game, it appears, and that might be one factor helping buttress European shares early Tuesday.\n\nU.S. stocks might be getting some support from a weaker dollar, as the Dollar Index fell again Monday and remained below recent highs. \n\nOne thing that might be holding the Fed back could be low rates overseas. The German bund yield is under 0.1%, compared with U.S. 10-year yields that finished just above 2.6% on Monday. That\'s a pretty wide divergence. \n\n### Checking Resistance Levels\n\nThe S&P 500 (SPX) rose again Monday but closed just short of clearing a resistance area between 2831 and 2834, finishing right in the middle of that band. A push above that to close higher on Tuesday, if it happens, might be viewed as a sign of technical strength.\n\nMeanwhile, the Dow Jones Industrial Average ($DJI) has a four-session win streak going. But with Boeing still under pressure, the $DJI again under-performed the SPX on Monday. \n\nSome analysts say follow-through buying from Friday\'s rally appeared to be a factor Monday on a day when fresh news catalysts were a bit lacking.\n\n### Cyclicals Led Wall Street To Start Week\n\nFrom a sector perspective, cyclicals shined Monday, which is sometimes seen as a potential sign of underlying investor confidence. Some of the leading sectors included Energy, Financials, Consumer Discretionary, and Industrials.\n\nOne sector that didn\'t do so well was Communication Services, which got weighed on in part by weakness in **Facebook, Inc.  **(NASDAQ:FB). That company\'s stock had its worst day of the year, falling more than 3% amid concern about executive departures and an analyst downgrade. However, the FB softness didn\'t extend much to the other FAANGs, as three of the other four rose. **Amazon.com, Inc.  **(NASDAQ:AMZN) and **Apple Inc  **(NASDAQ:AAPL) - which has been on a roll - were particularly strong. \n\nThe analyst downgrading FB warned of strategic, regulatory and brand risks, Briefing.com noted.\n\nSpeaking of downgrades, **JPMorgan Chase & Co** (NYSE:JPM) downgraded **Yum! Brands, Inc.** (NYSE:YUM), sending that stock lower in pre-market trading. Some of the food brands have done well recently, like **Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.  **(NYSE:CMG) and **McDonald \'s Corp **(NYSE:MCD), so we\'ll see if this is an isolated move or if it spreads.\n\nChipmaker stocks were mostly lower Monday ahead of **Micron Technology, Inc.  **(NASDAQ:MU) earnings later this week. Some analysts are worried about falling chip pricing and how that might factor into the company\'s quarter.\n\nSo far this year, the SPX is up just over 13%, while the DJI is up just above 11%. The Nasdaq Composite (up 16.3%) is out-performing both. Meanwhile, volatility, as measured by VIX, rose just slightly on Monday but remains near 2019 lows just above 13.\n\n### Crude Jumps\n\nU.S. crude prices hit a four-month high and are threatening $60 a barrel after OPEC canceled its April meeting and Saudi Arabia said output cuts might extend into the second half of the year, according to media reports. Crude struggled a bit late last week amid economic fears, but anyone who was hoping OPEC might turn up the spigot or even say a few bearish words at the April meeting was probably disappointed with Monday\'s events.\n\nOne question is whether rising oil prices might start to have an impact on commodity-sensitive stocks. Energy stocks performed well on Monday, which might stand to reason, but so far the higher crude costs haven\'t seemed to hurt transportation-related companies. The Dow Jones Transportation Average ($DJT) rose Monday. That index has been recovering the last week after a long slide in early March. This could reflect consumer health.\n\n**Yielding Less** : The yield on the 10-year Treasury has been moving lower in recent sessions. Part of that may be because foreign investors might be piling into U.S. Treasuries to get better yields than they can get at home, boosting Treasury prices, which move inversely to yields. Data Source: Cboe. Chart source: The thinkorswim® platform from TD Ameritrade. _For illustrative purposes only. Past performance does not guarantee future results._\n\n**Fed Funds Futures** : Investors appear to see more of a chance for declining rates than rising ones. While the CME futures market, as of Monday, put chances of any rate move this week at less than 2%, the market shows no chance of a hike at the June meeting and a nearly 15% chance of a rate cut by that time. Looking farther ahead, the futures market sees more than a 25% chance of rates being lower than they are now by the end of the year, and zero chance of them being higher. That\'s quite a turn-around from late last year, when historic data shows the futures market was pricing in around a 40% chance of at least one rate hike in 2019.\n\n**Silver Linings** : If we end up seeing strong earnings from **FedEx Corporation  **(NYSE:FDX) after the close today and **Nike Inc  **(NYSE:NKE) later in the week, it could help to back up what some of the economic data have been telling investors about U.S. consumers being in good shape. It appears consumers are out continuing to spend money and help keep the economy going. That may be a counterpoint to worries about slowing economic growth. True, GDP forecasts have been trimmed and clouds continue hanging over the global trade situation. But it\'s not all doom and gloom. Though the February jobs report was disappointing, many analysts are writing it off to some extent due to cold weather that month and the lingering effects of the government shutdown. Other data, including last Friday\'s better-than-expected March University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment report and last week\'s January retail sales report, arguably could serve as counterweights to the weak jobs data. \n\n**Affordability Still An Issue** : While mortgage rates have been falling, overall home affordability continues to be a headwind for the housing market. "Affordability still remains a key concern for builders," the National Association of Home Builders said in a press release Monday. "The skilled worker shortage, lack of buildable lots and stiff zoning restrictions in many major metro markets are among the challenges builders face as they strive to construct homes that can sell at affordable price points." However, more builders are reporting that lower-priced houses are selling well, echoing the data in the new home sales report last week. A report on February existing home sales is due out later this week. It might be interesting to see if a drop in borrowing costs has given consumers new appetite for home buying as mortgage rates have generally been declining since late last year.\n\n_Information from TDA is not intended to be investment advice or construed as a recommendation or endorsement of any particular investment or investment strategy, and is for illustrative purposes only.

 '**Amazon.com, Inc.**(NASDAQ:AMZN) is offering to take near-complete control of customers\' ocean shipping from China to the U.S. in return for the merchants accepting lower selling prices for their goods, according to a leading freight forwarder that operates on the trade lane.\n\nHowever, Ryan Petersen, founder and CEO of San Francisco-based Flexport, said businesses are not lining up to use the service out of concern the Seattle-based e-tailer will use the information that is required to process goods at U.S. ports of entry to gain valuable insight into their customers\' supply chains. Armed with data that includes the names of every supplier and the prices paid for goods, Amazon could acquire the intelligence needed to develop competing products, according to Petersen.\n\nAmazon\'s plan is to deliver goods "freight on board," meaning it assumes the shipping costs from the time the products are loaded aboard a vessel in China to when they reach one of the Fulfillment by Amazon (FBA) facilities in the U.S. Most goods are stored at an FBA location for a brief time before they are picked, packed and shipped to the end-customer. Under the initiative, which was rolled out under-the-radar, the merchant would be freed from the costs and the difficulties of the international distribution process, and would charge a lower selling price than if the merchant had to pay for shipping.\n\nAccording to Petersen, the merchants are not actually buying ocean freight services from Amazon. Instead, they are just getting paid less for their products while Amazon takes care of the shipping\n\nPetersen and his company became visible in early 2017 when he disclosed in a blog post that Amazon\'s Chinese operations had been authorized by the U.S. Federal Maritime Commission (FMC) to operate as an ocean freight forwarder. Amazon\'s operating license shows the trade name "Amazon China," though the official name on the FMC registry is "Beijing Century JOYO Courier Service Co. Ltd."\n\nAt the start of 2019, Amazon began marketing its ocean services to U.S. businesses in China; before that, it was available just to Chinese merchants. An Amazon spokesperson said the arrangement described by Petersen is voluntary and is not a requirement to enter into an ocean relationship with the company\n\nPetersen said that Amazon has courted many of Flexport\'s customers, but that "none have accepted because people are not comfortable sharing all the secrets of their international supply chain with a company notorious for cloning products and selling them under their 400+ house brands."\n\nAmazon\'s current share of the U.S.-China ocean freight market is inconsequential. However, those who\'ve tracked the arc of Amazon\'s supply chain offerings recognize that each step is part of a larger, multi-year strategy to drive out all provider incumbents and leave it as the only intermediary between a producer (or a seller) and consumers.\n\nFor years Amazon has been constructing a transport and logistics network to move goods sold on its website, more than half of which come from merchants who use the FBA service. The seismic change will occur should Amazon begin marketing its logistics offerings as a separate service to all shippers, not just those who sell goods on its site.\n\nEarlier this year, Flexport landed a $1 billion investment from a group of investors led by the Japanese firm SoftBank Group, run by the businessman and entrepreneur Masayoshi Sun.\n\nWant more content like this?

Now, it\'s ready for the big leagues.\n\nManagement announced Tuesday it will break into video games with a new streaming service, gaming hardware and content. Analysts are thrilled.\n\nBank of America Merrill Lynch analysts Justin Post and Benjamin Sherlund maintained a Buy rating and $1,350 price target on Alphabet. KeyBanc Capital Markets analysts Evan Wingren and Andy Hargreaves maintained an Overweight rating and $1,430 target, while Tigress Financial managing partner Ivan Feinseth recommends purchase.\n\n### **The Theses**\n\nGoogle\'s "Stadia" streaming service will live in the company cloud, open in Chrome or Chromecast, and require no console or download to play. While Google will market Stadia controllers, the system will be compatible with any device and third-party controller.\n\nThe service, slated for launch in 2019, is seen to be a boon for both publishers and Google.\n\n"By offering a platform to gamers without the high barriers of entry of traditional gaming (expensive PCs or consoles), Google may expand the gaming market for AAA content (mobile market has over 2 billion players)," Post and Sherlund wrote in a note. "With YouTube being the \'lobby\' for game access and Stadia offering the ability push to connect to games from YouTube, Stadia could be a tailwind to YouTube engagement and monetization."\n\nFeinseth agreed that YouTube integration yields significant growth and upside opportunities.\n\nAnalysts anticipate competition from **Microsoft Corporation**(NASDAQ:MSFT), which is already established in the content and console space, as well as **Amazon.com, Inc.** (NASDAQ:AMZN) and **Apple Inc.** (NASDAQ:AAPL).\n\n### **Roll-Out Hold-Ups**\n\nKeyBanc also suspects internet mechanics may prove inhibitive in the near term.\n\n"Although we came away very impressed by the rollout, we believe internet speed could remain a material bottleneck for global adoption," Wingren and Hargreaves wrote.\n\nBank of America Merrill Lynch noted that, if latency issues are overcome, Google stands to reap big rewards.\n\n"If the service can launch with low latency as expected, we think Stadia will demonstrate the potential power of the Google cloud network in a 5G world (which could power the Internet of Things [IoT] and self-driving autos)," Post and Sherlund wrote. "Investors could, in turn, be more optimistic on capex investments."\n\n### **Secondary Effects**\n\nStadia could remove barriers to the gaming industry as it cuts consumer costs, download time, and hardware or connectivity limitations.\n\n"If Google can deliver on its promises, this technology has the potential to be highly disruptive; it is promising an ambitious service that can deliver 4K (and even 8K) gaming at scale globally that is ubiquitous and cross platform with low latency," Wingren and Hargreaves wrote. "This is the holy grail for game makers."\n\nIt is seen to expand the total addressable market for publishers like **Activision Blizzard, Inc.** (NASDAQ:ATVI), **Electronic Arts Inc.** (NASDAQ:EA) and **Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc.**(NASDAQ:TTWO).\n\n"By moving the compute power to the network, Google would help to accelerate the streaming transition, open up gaming to new players and allow for more advanced game play such as Battle Royal modes with 1,000s of players which was previously not possible," Post and Sherlund wrote.\n\nAs Google builds its market, Bank of America Merrill Lynch expects publisher collaborations, content licensing deals or acquisitions of content studios.\n\n**Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.**(NASDAQ:AMD) may see more action, too. Google is using custom AMD chips for Stadia services but may see fit to expand the relationship.\n\n"The new AMD/Alphabet partnership creates a significant opportunity for AMD and opens up the possibility that AMD chips could be used in other Alphabet/Google applications," Feinseth wrote.\n\n_Related Links:_\n\n_Battle Royale: Morgan Stanley Cautiously Upbeat On EA, Activision_\n\n_Snap Reportedly Set To Launch Gaming Platform In April_\n\n### Top Upgrades\n\n  * Analysts at JMP Securities upgraded **Cree, Inc.** (NASDAQ:CREE) from Market Perform to Market Outperform.

 '**Fidelity National Information Servcs Inc** (NYSE:FIS) this week announced a massive $34-billion buyout of e-commerce and payments company **Worldpay, Inc.** (NYSE:WP). The payment deal isn\'t the first M&A announcement in the sector his year, and momentum could be growing for a major wave of digital payment consolidation this year.\n\n### Major Deals\n\nThe $34-billion Worldpay deal comes roughly two months after **Fiserv, Inc.** (NASDAQ:FISV) reached an agreement to acquire **First Data Corp** (NYSE:FDC) for $22 billion. The two deals are creating major new competitors in the global payments space to compete with the likes of **Paypal Holdings Inc** (NASDAQ:PYPL) and **Square, Inc.** (NYSE:SQ).\n\nEven PayPal and Square have been on a shopping spree. PayPal\'s last major deal was a $2.2-billion deal for **iZettle** just last year. Square acquired website builder **Weebly** for $365 million in 2018.\n\nFIS and Worldpay combined for $12.3 billion in 2018 revenue.\n\n### More Mergers Ahead?\n\nWedbush analyst Moshe Katri said investors can expect more consolidation in the fintech space, especially in two specific areas.\n\nThe first type would be in-line with the recent "mega-deals" -- Fiserv acquiring First Data and FIS acquiring Worldpay -- in which financial and card processors are taking on merchant processing capabilities, the analyst told Benzinga.\n\nAcquirers such as **Jack Henry & Associates** (NYSE:JKHY) could be on the hunt for targets such as **Total System Services, Inc.**(NASDAQ:TSS), **EVO Payments Inc** (NASDAQ:EVOP) or **i3 Verticals Inc** (NASDAQ:IIIV), Katri said.\n\nThe second area of consolidation likely will be "transactions in the merchant processing space aiming at building integrated payments capabilities, or expanding into \'niche\' SMB segments," he said.\n\nIn this case, acquirers such as **Amazon.com, Inc.** (NASDAQ:AMZN) and **JPMorgan Chase & Co** (NYSE:JPM) would potentially be targeting companies like Total System Services, **Global Payments Inc** (NYSE:GPN) or even PayPal or Square, Katri said.\n\n### Analysts Bullish\n\nWith or without additional buyout deals, Guggenheim analyst Jeff Cantwell recently said he\'s bullish on payment stocks in 2019. The fundamentals in the payments space are far better than market valuations suggest, Cantwell said, adding that he\'s expecting double-digit revenue growth across the board in 2019, with some companies clearing that bar by a wide margin.\n\nBuy-rated First Data, Paypal, Square and Worldpay will be among the fastest-growing payments companies this year, the Guggenheim analyst said.\n\n_Related Links:_\n\n_Guggenheim\'s Positive Outlook For Payments Stocks: \'We Expect Strong Results\'_\n\n_Worldpay Sold To Fidelity National In $34B Deal To\'Accelerate The Future Of Finance\'_\n\n_Photo courtesy of Square._\n\nThe **Invesco QQQ**(NASDAQ:QQQ) recently turned 20 years old and today is home to $71.82 billion in assets under management, making it one of the largest U.S.-listed exchange traded funds.\n\nOne of the primary reasons advisors and investors have widely embraced QQQ is because the fund provides efficient access to some of the largest Internet and technology names.\n\n### What To Know\n\nWhile there is no denying that large-cap Internet and technology names, such as **Alphabet Inc.** (NASDAQ:GOOG), **Apple Inc.** (NASDAQ:AAPL) and **Microsoft Corp.** (NASDAQ:MSFT), rally, QQQ follows suit, there are other compelling options for accessing the Nasdaq-100 Index.\n\nWith the Nasdaq-100 Equal-Weight Index hitting another record high Wednesday, the **Direxion NASDAQ-100 Equal Weighted Index Shares**(NYSE:QQQE) reminds investors that equally weighting the Nasdaq-100 Index can pay off.\n\n### Why It\'s Important\n\nYear to date, the equal-weight QQQE is up 17.63 percent, topping the cap-weighted Nasdaq-100 Index by about 155 basis points. Due to the dominance of stocks such as Microsoft, Apple and **Amazon.com** (NASDAQ:AMZN) in the cap-weighted Nasdaq-100, there are times when that index will beat its equal-weight counterpart. Conversely, there are also periods when the equal-index will top its cap-weighted rival.\n\nSome of the benefits using QQQE as an alternative to the cap-weighted Nasdaq-100 are reducing concentration risk and potentially lowering downside capture when technology stocks falter.\n\nThe cap-weighted Nasdaq-100 allocates about 43 percent of its weight to the technology sector. While that\'s well of the high of 78 percent in 2000, that\'s still more than double the S&P 500\'s weight to that sector. QQQE\'s tech weight is higher compared to the S&P 500, but at 37.27 percent, it\'s well below that of the cap-weighted Nasdaq-100.\n\nQQQE is also under weight communication services stocks by nearly 900 basis points compared to the cap-weighted Nasdaq-100, reducing the Direxion fund\'s vulnerabilities to downside in stocks such as Alphabet and **Facebook Inc.**(NASDAQ:FB).\n\n### What\'s Next\n\nNo one knows what\'s next for QQQE, but with the Nasdaq-100 racing higher, the fund could be increasingly appealing for investors looking to capture some of that upside while not being highly exposed to a small number of stocks.\n\n_Related Links_\n\n_A New Fintech ETF_\n\n_Different Looks At Chip ETFs_\n\n_Photo credit:bfishadow, Flickr_\n\n**Ford Motor Co.** (NYSE:F) confirmed Thursday it has hired longtime former **Amazon.com Inc.** (NASDAQ:AMZN) executive Tim Stone to be the automaker\'s chief financial officer, replacing Ford veteran Bob Shanks, who is retiring later this year.\n\nStone, 52, comes to Ford from **Snap Inc.** (NYSE:SNAP), where he had been CFO since last year. Before that, Stone was at Amazon for 20 years, as vice president of finance, and for periods as CFO for Amazon divisions dealing with web services and eBooks, according to his LinkedIn page.\n\n### Credited With Improving Snap\n\nStone was brought to Snap last year to try to help it get back on track and was credited with improvements in efficiency and communications with Wall Street. When he left, it raised questions about what might be going on.\n\nStone starts at Ford April 15 and will take over as CFO June 1.\n\nStone\'s background in tech may help Ford as it modernizes, including a push into autonomous vehicles, part of what Ford President and CEO Jim Hackett called a future for Ford of "designing smart vehicles for a smart world."\n\n"(Stone) was a key player in the incredible success at Amazon and he understands the principles of fitness and growth as complementary virtues for Ford\'s future," Hackett said.\n\nHe also praised Shanks, 66, who will retire after 42 years with the iconic American car maker.\n\n"Bob\'s leadership was integral to Ford\'s comeback during the great recession, and he has been an invaluable partner as we transform Ford to succeed in the next era."\n\nOther company officials have also said Shanks was instrumental in helping turn the company around.\n\n### Price Action\n\nShares of Ford were up 1.4 percent Thursday afternoon, trading at $8.63.\n\n_Related Links:_\n\n_GM Pulls Ahead Of Ford In Just About All Competitions, Morgan Stanley Says_\n\n_Jefferies: Snap\'s New CFO Is A Positive, Decline In User Growth A Concern_\n\n_Photo courtesy of Ford Motor._\n\n**GrubHub, Inc.** (NASDAQ:GRUB) is one of the most heavily shorted stocks on Wall Street, but financial technology and analytics firm S3 Partners analyst Ihor Dusaniwsky said Wednesday GrubHub short sellers have been aggressively selling the stock this week after an extended absence.\n\n### A Popular Short\n\nGrubHub has an outstanding short position of 15.12 million shares worth about $1.07 billion. That short position makes GrubHub the fifth most shorted stock in the U.S. Internet & Direct Marketing Retail sector behind only **Amazon.com, Inc.** (NASDAQ:AMZN), **Wayfair Inc** (NYSE:W), **Booking Holdings Inc** (NASDAQ:BKNG) and **Expedia Group Inc** (NASDAQ:EXPE).\n\nIn terms of short percent of float, GrubHub\'s 16.6 percent ratio is higher than any of the other companies mentioned other that Wayfair (24 percent).\n\nGrubHub short sellers have had a pretty good start to 2019 with the stock down more than 10 percent in a hot market. Dusaniwsky said short sellers started piling into the stock starting at around September of 2018. From September to February of 2019, GrubHub\'s short position tripled, increasing by about 10.3 million shares. During that stretch, the stock\'s share price dropped by more than 40 percent.\n\n### Short Sellers Return\n\nIn the month of March, however, Dusaniwsky said short sellers seemed to take a breather, decreasing their position by 392,000 shares in the first couple of weeks of the month. Dusaniwsky said short sellers returned aggressively on Wednesday, triggering a spike in GrubHub\'s short position.\n\n"Increased competition and declining user trends, as highlighted by Andy Hargreaves of Keybanc Capital Markets, may spur short sellers to increase their short exposure to the stock," Dusaniwsky wrote in report.\n\nGrubHub has been a profitable trade for short sellers in the past two quarters. Dusaniwsky said short sellers collectively netted$436.3 million in profits in the fourth quarter of 2018 and are up another $110.3 million so far in the first quarter of 2019.\n\n_Related Links:_\n\n_Disappointing Guidance Earns Turtle Beach Short Sellers $24M _\n\n_S3 Partners: Longs, Not Shorts, Are Selling Tesla_\n\n_Photo courtesy of GrubHub._'
 'After holding its viewership data cards close to its chest, **Netflix** (NASDAQ:NFLX) revealed some interesting numbers regarding some of its content.\n\nRomantic comedies were at the top of the Netflix best list for 2018, the company said in a December press release. The most-watched and rewatched movies included "Roxanne Roxanne," "To All the Boys I\'ve Loved Before" and "The Kissing Booth."\n\nFor its list of most-loved actors from 2018, Netflix rates these by increases in Instagram followers.\n\nTopping the list was the "New Queer Eye" (all five actors), followed by Lana Condor from "All the Boys I\'ve Loved Before" and Joel Courtney from "The Kissing Booth."\n\nThe Netflix show "You" enjoyed a huge debut after a very drab showing on the Lifetime Channel. The same can be said for the series "Sex Education," and the feature movie "The Bird Box" is on pace to acquire 80 million household viewers.\n\nNielsen measures limited viewer numbers for the streaming service. These numbers reflect TV viewing in the U.S. only and do not include other devices or other countries.\n\n### Why It\'s Important\n\nThe streaming service has been secretive about its viewing data up until recently, and these few insights do not qualify as a deep dive behind the curtain of the streaming giant.\n\nIn 2017, Netflix members watched more than 140 million hours per day, and TechCrunch suggested the reported number of hours viewed may have decreased in 2018 relative to previous years.\n\nAt the end of 2015, Netflix announced that its 74.7 million users had watched 42.5 billion hours of content. Those numbers translated into 570 million hours per year per account compared to 480 million hours per account this year.\n\nNetflix has more than 100 million users now and included only its original content in the counting this year -- which may explain the drop in numbers.\n\n### What\'s Next\n\nThe series "House of Cards" was just the beginning: now "Stranger Things" and other popular Netflix series have become water cooler banter. \n\nIn order to continue growing for its investors, Netflix is counting on non-subscribers joining the masses. \n\nAt the recent INTV Conference, Cindy Holland, Netflix\'s VP for original content, revealed that the average subscriber watches two hours of Netflix every day, according to Variety. \n\nWhen asked to comment on competition from **Apple Inc.** (NASDAQ:AAPL), **Amazon.com, Inc.**(NASDAQ:AMZN) and **Walt Disney Co**(NYSE:DIS), Holland said the challenge for any newcomer is to grow in the future.\n\n"We\'re very different from the large tech companies like Google and Facebook," Variety quoted Holland as saying. "We have a different business model [and we\'re] much closer to cable TV." \n\nHolland said Netflix is focused on increasing its international output, citing "Narcos" as a global success. Netflix is established in 190 countries and now makes more than 80 percent of its acquisitions outside the U.S.\n\n_Related Links:  _\n\n_JPMorgan Says Apple Should Go After Netflix, Sonos Or Activision _\n\n_Cramer Breaks Down Investing In Streaming Video: Content Is King _'
 '**Apple Inc.**(NASDAQ:AAPL) rolled out its much-awaited video streaming move with Apple TV+ and Apple TV Channels on Monday, along with other expanded services for delivering games and news articles for subscribers for single monthly fees.\n\nApple is seeking to be the go-to place for TV and movie watchers, gamers and news readers - eventually seen by many as a competitor with**Netflix, Inc.** (NASDAQ:NFLX) for TV and movie viewers while trying to replicate that model by also offering a one-stop shop for games and news. \n\nIn a star-studded roll-out that included Steven Spielberg, Oprah Winfrey and Steve Carell, among others, Apple CEO Tim Cook rolled out an expanded vision for Apple as an entertainment and information service provider rather than just a producer of computers and phones.\n\n### Apple TV Plus and Apple TV Channels\n\nApple TV+ will include original Apple programming - as Netflix has done, with a library of original content hinted at by the stars who were at the Apple rollout.\n\nSpielberg announced he will work on a TV series called "Amazing Stories" for Apple TV+, while Reese Witherspoon, Jennifer Aniston and Steve Carell were shown off as the hosts of a new morning show.\n\nApple also is creating a digital entertainment hub where users can bundle their various subscriptions. The app will let users pay for other streaming services, including HBO, Showtime and others, through the Apple app. That part of Apple\'s service is called Apple Channels.\n\n"This is how TV should work," said Apple\'s Peter Stern. "Now it does with Apple Channels.... No more bouncing around from app to app."\n\nNetflix won\'t be a part of that. Netflix CEO Reed Hastings said recently it\'s choosing not to integrate its streaming service with Apple\'s as part of an effort to keep control of Netflix users\' experience. The Apple TV app, already available on iPads, iPhones, will also be available on Macs and various smart TVs, as well as **Roku Inc**(NASDAQ:ROKU) and **Amazon.com, Inc.** (NASDAQ:AMZN) Fire TV devices.\n\n_See Also:Raymond James Says Apple\'s Streaming Plans Are \'More Incremental Than Revolutionary,\' Which Is A Good Thing For Netflix_\n\n### Move To Services\n\nCook noted the iconic tech company has long delivered services like its mapping and music services along with its better-known hardware products like computers and smartphones. But the company is shifting heavily toward services as sales of the company\'s signature product, the iPhone have hit a plateau.\n\nApple products like the iPhone aren\'t becoming obsolete - in fact some analysts see the move as a new way for the Cupertino, Calif.-based Apple to earn money from its iPhone user base, which is closing in on 1 billion customers worldwide. But Apple is transitioning more to a content delivery company.\n\n### Apple Arcade\n\nApple also announced its subscription game service called Apple Arcade. The service won\'t allow streaming play, but is more like a subscription service for games that can be downloaded from the App Store. Subscribers will also be able to try out games.\n\nCook announced that more than 1 billion gamers have downloaded games from the App Store.\n\n_See Also:  What To Know About Apple News+, The Tech Giant\'s News Subscription Service_\n\n### Apple News+\n\nApple also announced a new $9.99 per month subscription service called Apple News + that will give users access to articles from more than 300 newspapers and magazines. It starts this month and is free for the first month.\n\nApple said magazines including National Geographic, The New Yorker and Wired will be included, along with newspapers including the Los Angeles Times and the Wall Street Journal.\n\nCook and other Apple officials touted privacy throughout the presentation, including with the news service. The company said it won\'t let advertisers track Apple News+ users.\n\n### Apple Card\n\nApple also rolled out changes to its credit-card like online payment service with an expansion of its popular Apple Pay service to be called Apple Card. It allows people to pay for products using personal devices with an online credit card. The service is in partnership with **Goldman Sachs** (NYSE:GS) and **Mastercard**(NYSE:MS), which will create widespread acceptance, the company says.\n\n**Price Action**\n\nApple\'s stock was down 1.9 percent after the presentation to $187.33 per share.'
 'Ridesharing giant **Lyft**(NASDAQ:LYFT) is going public this week at an estimated valuation of at least $20 billion. This is just weeks before the anticipated IPO of larger competitor Uber, which is valued at around $120 billion. Palantir ($41 billion valuation), Airbnb ($31 billion valuation) and Pinterest ($12 billion valuation) are also among a crowded group of potential 2019 mega-IPOs, and investors are trying to understand what to make of the newest Silicon Valley giants to take Wall Street by storm.\n\nRecode editor-at-large Kara Swisher discussed Uber, Lyft and Pinterest on CNBC this week. Both Uber and Lyft are extremely popular companies with plenty of brand value, but both reported massive losses in 2018 and have yet to prove they have viable long-term business models.\n\n"These S-1s from Lyft and Uber are tough," said Swisher. "They\'re tough going from a financial point of view."\n\n### **Unproven Models**\n\nSwisher said Uber and Lyft will likely see most of their early successes in densely populated cities. However, just because the economics of operating in rural areas doesn\'t work today doesn\'t mean they won\'t figure it out eventually. Swisher said plenty of people questioned **Amazon.com, Inc.** (NASDAQ:AMZN) and its early delivery business model as well.\n\nShe also said the global ridesharing industry could consolidate over time, and more legacy automakers will be looking toward Silicon Valley for partnerships and acquisitions. Swisher gave **Tesla, Inc**(NASDAQ:TSLA) credit for spooking the auto industry into innovating.\n\n"Whatever you think about what\'s going on at Tesla and with Elon Musk, he has shifted the discussion really significantly in that regard," she said.\n\nSwisher will be moderating multiple sessions on technological innovation and venture capital at the upcoming SALT Conference in Las Vegas starting on May 7.\n\n### **Pinterest \'s Unique Approach**\n\nPinterest\'s S-1 filing set the company apart from many of its growth-at-any-cost peers. Revenue was up 56 percent in 2018, but earnings losses actually narrowed by more than 50 percent. Swisher said Pinterest CEO Ben Silbermann is not the typical Silicon Valley CEO.\n\n"He\'s a very interesting CEO, and I sometimes joke that he doesn\'t even want to be a CEO," she said. "They want to be able to get to good profits in a much calmer way, but at the same time they want to go public."\n\nHowever, Swisher was less fulsome on the share classes implemented by companies like Lyft and Pinterest, which give company insiders 20 votes each for their shares while public investors get only one vote per share.\n\n"I think the idea of people holding onto [controlling interest] is for the safety of that company because when it goes out with these numbers it\'s going to be problematic," Swisher said. "I think they\'ve watched other IPOs and are responding to that."\n\nDespite the risks involved in these high-profile tech IPOs, there certainly seems to be plenty of market demand for shares. Reuters reported that the Lyft IPO was already oversubscribed on day two of the company\'s investor roadshow.\n\n_Related Links:_\n\n_Uber IPO Roadshow Set For Next Month_ __\n\n_Considering High-Profile IPOs: How Do These Stocks Trade The Day After Their First Earnings Report?_\n\n_Photo Credit:__Loic Le Meur viaFlickr_\n\n**Apple Inc.** (NASDAQ:AAPL) held a presentation Monday where management detailed new products and services -- but there may be other more attractive plays in the market for investors outside of the iPhone maker\'s stock. \n\n### Chantico Global\'s Sanchez: Apple Entering Mature Markets\n\nApple will face challenges ahead in its new ventures, since it is "planting flags" in markets that are already "fairly mature," Chantico Global\'s Gina Sanchez said on CNBC\'s "Trading Nation" segment Tuesday. Apple "has to make a pivot" into new ventures, which presents a challenge for Cupertino, she said. \n\nThe company is also making a major selling point of privacy as it pledges not to sell consumer data, Sanchez said. \n\n### Oppenheimer\'s Wald: Premium On Apple-Like Companies\n\nApple\'s presentation comes at a time when its new ventures continue to show encouraging macro tailwinds, said Oppenheimer\'s Ari Wald. It also comes at a time when interest rates across the world signal a potential slowdown in the global economy.\n\nA "premium will continue to be placed" on large-cap, quality companies like Apple, the analyst said. \n\nAside from Apple, **Microsoft Corporation** (NASDAQ:MSFT) traded above its old all-time highs and recently hit a new all-time high of $120.82. What\'s encouraging is that the stock did so in the current "mixed and questionable" environment, he said. \n\n**Amazon.com, Inc.** (NASDAQ:AMZN)\'s stock is proving to be the "most tactical its been in years," Wald said. The stock\'s weekly MACD recently inflected positive from the most oversold condition seen since 2014.\n\n_Related Links:_\n\n_Analyst: Apple\'s New Credit Card Bodes Well For Green Dot_\n\n_Apple Rolls Out Streaming Service Apple TV+, TV Channels_\n\n_Oprah Winfrey at Apple \'s Monday presentation. Courtesy photo. _\n\n**Amazon.com, Inc.** (NASDAQ:AMZN) demand signals remain vibrant, a Cowen analyst said Tuesday after attending a conference for participants across the Amazon ecosystem.\n\n### The Analyst \n\nCowen analyst John Blackledge maintains an Outperform rating with a $2,250 price target.\n\n### The Thesis\n\nE-commerce in the furniture and home furnishings vertical should grow from $68 billion in 2019 to $135 billion in 2024, with e-commerce penetration going from 22 percent to 34 percent of sales over the period, according to Cowen\'s projections. \n\n### Amazon Home Business Outlook\n\nBlackledge said he met with one of the largest home sellers on Amazon, and said the unnamed company expects to generate total revenue of $50 million 2019, with 60 percent of revenue generated on Amazon in North America -- a 30-40 percent gain year-over-year.\n\nThe same home seller said its business on **Wayfair Inc** (NYSE:W) is seeing rapid growth, with the platform budgeted for 30 percent of the total business in 2019, growing 150 percent year-over-year, the analyst said in a Tuesday note. \n\nAmazon\'s business advertising is still in beta, and the seller\'s ad spend is capped, Blackledge said.\n\n"While this home seller lists the same SKUs on Wayfair vs. Amazon, the bulk of their goods on W are listed under house brands. The home seller started advertising on W in [the fourth quarter] and is pleased with results, highlighting strong ROI and a user-friendly interface (though less sophisticated vs AMZN given it recently launched)."\n\n### Amazon Advertising Update\n\nAfter speaking with the CEO of an Amazon ad agency, the analyst said significant runway exists for Amazon advertising.\n\nCowen estimates Amazon advertising revenue of $13 billion in 2019, representing 52-percent growth year-over-year.\n\nThe executive mentioned several changes to Amazon\'s advertising business, including a video in-browsing experience that is being sold on a cost-per-view basis, Blackledge said. \n\n"The ad unit is still in beta but is being rolled out to non-iOS devices this month. The exec thought this ad unit could have significant potential." \n\nChanges were also made to product targeting, where advertisers can target an entire product category, the brands it competes with or products with similar star reviews. Dynamic bidding was also introduced, where advertisers can adjust their bids up or down for certain ad placements.\n\n"In the past, if Amazon knew during the auction that a bid wouldn\'t convert, they would adjust bids down by a certain amount. Advertisers can still do fixed bids, which the exec thought should be used for new product launches," the analyst said. \n\n### Project Zero\n\nAfter speaking with an ex-Amazon executive, Blackledge said the company is transitioning to an automated purchase order system that incorporates machine learning to sniff out potential counterfeits. The initiative is named "Project Zero," as Amazon to completely eliminate counterfeiting on its platform.\n\n"While the program is in a trial phase, Amazon has partnered with brands such as Vera Bradley and Chom Chom Roller, among others, to test the various counterfeit prevention tools."\n\n### Price Action\n\nAmazon shares were up 0.36 percent at $1,780.67 at the time of publication Tuesday. \n\n_Related Links:_\n\n_Amazon Says No Thanks To NYC: What Do The Experts Think?_\n\n_Amazon, Costco Make Cramer\'s Shopping List -- And Kroger\'s Crossed Off_\n\n_Photo courtesy of Amazon.  _\n\nOur brains are wired to like new things, even when they aren\'t necessarily better than the old. In the world of investing, nothing is newer or can generate more excitement than an initial public offering--commonly referred to as an IPO. There\'s a lot of buzz surrounding IPOs and speculation runs rampant as to who will be the next company to file and when.\n\nIPOs that typically create the most buzz are often well-known brands experiencing rapid sales growth in newer industries. Think companies like **Snap Inc  **(NYSE:SNAP), **Fitbit Inc  **(NYSE:FIT), **GoPro Inc  **(NASDAQ:GPRO), or **Facebook Inc  **(NASDAQ:FB).\n\nShares for headline-generating IPOs can be oversubscribed, meaning demand is much greater than supply for the new shares. This may cause the price to rise when the newly issued stock first begins trading on a public exchange. On the other hand, if the supply of shares is much greater than demand, the stock price can rapidly decline.\n\nWhile you might think you\'re buying the next **Amazon.com, Inc.** (NASDAQ:AMZN) or **Microsoft**(NASDAQ:MSFT), there\'s also a chance you\'re buying the next Fitbit or drkoop.com. In case you\'re wondering, things didn\'t end very well for investors in drkoop.com\'s IPO, which reached a valuation of more than $1 billion following its 1999 IPO. Drkoop.com was eventually sold for $186,000 in bankruptcy court in 2002. Fitbit investors fared better, but as of March 2019, shares have still declined more than 70% from its 2015 IPO price of $20.00 per share as the company\'s sales growth and profitability declined.\n\n### The Next Big Winner or the Next Big Loser?\n\nInvesting in IPOs comes with different risks than investing in an established publicly traded company since they are frequently newer companies in younger industries; and they don\'t have the history of older, more established publicly traded companies, which helps when conducting research. Once public, the company\'s new shareholders may have different ideas how the company should be run, media scrutiny usually increases, there\'s greater oversight and regulations from the SEC, and new investors have high expectations for the company\'s future growth.\n\nFitbit, GoPro and Snap are just some examples of "hot IPOs" that didn\'t live up to their hype. Many analysts were optimistic about the growth of each company, but the investors who bought these companies when they first went public have experienced large negative returns and underperformed the S&P 500 (SPX) (see figure 1 below). \n\n**FIGURE 1: FIT DOESN \'T SEEM TO BE SHAPING UP.** Since its IPO in mid-2015, FIT stock has plummeted as the company\'s growth slowed.

Past performance does not guarantee future results.  \nThere have been IPOs that generated substantial returns, but it\'d take nerves of steel to have bought Amazon, Apple, or Microsoft and not sold your shares at some point since. Just check out Amazon\'s stock chart in Figure 2 below. Some of the most successful IPOs have also been some of the most volatile. Investors in Apple saw the stock price plunge 71% in 2000 and 57% in 2008 (the S&P 500 declined 9% in 2000 and 36% in 2008). Microsoft has earned its investors substantial returns since its 1986 IPO, but they had to hold on tight when the stock price declined almost 70% from the beginning of 2000 to the end of 2008. \n\n**FIGURE 2: AMZN SINCE THE START**. Since its IPO in May 1997, AMZN stock has provided investors with a lot of volatility and some significant returns. Chart source: thinkorswim® by TD Ameritrade.  Data source: Standard & Poor\'s. Not a recommendation. For illustrative purposes only. Past performance does not guarantee future results.\n\n### Caveat Emptor: Buyer Beware\n\nLike any investment, it\'s a good idea to research any company that is planning to IPO to determine if it aligns with your financial goals. This isn\'t always the case, but newer companies in unproven industries could require more research to fully understand the business and risks.  \n\nThis is by no means an exhaustive list, but these are some things to consider before investing in an IPO:\n\nRead the SEC Form S-1. This must be filed for a company to register its securities before they can be listed on a public exchange. It provides a detailed look at the business, financial statements, potential risks and how the company plans on using the proceeds from the offering. You\'ll also find out important information like what type of shares are going to be available for purchase. More companies are issuing multiple classes of stock that concentrate voting power in the hands of a small number of owners.  \nCheck the lock-up period. Many companies compensate their teams with large stock awards, but they don\'t want employees to sell large amounts of stock as soon as the company starts trading so they use lock-up periods, which usually last 90 to 180 days and prevent employees and other insiders from selling their stock when the company goes public. The stock can be much more volatile depending on lock-up restrictions and these aren\'t always set in stone either. Fitbit lifted lock-up restrictions on 2 million shares early and announced an offering of 21 million additional shares not long after its IPO. When that happened, the stock declined 10% in after-hours trading following the news.  \nFear of Missing Out? It\'s easy to get excited by the buzz surrounding an IPO, but remember you don\'t need to buy the stock immediately.  If you wait several quarters, it will give you the chance to examine additional financial statements to see how the company is growing and management is spending the money it raised.  \nLearn if there is a holding period. If you participate in an IPO, be sure to to check with the company to see if there is a holding period where you are restricted from selling shares immediately after the IPO.  \nAll investments have different risks that should be considered, and IPOs are no exception. It can be tough, but don\'t let the hype influence your research. When your emotions get in the way, it might be easier to ignore all the things that could make that exciting IPO fizzle.  \n\nBefore investing in an Initial Public Offering, be sure that you are fully aware of the risks involved with this type of investing. There are a variety of risk factors typically associated with investing in new issue securities, any one of which may have a material and adverse effect on the price of the issuer\'s common stock. For a review of some of the more significant factors and special risks related to IPOs, we urge you to read our Risk Disclosure Statement.  \n\nFor more information on newly-public companies and other up-to-the-minute market news, tune in to TD Ameritrade Network for live programming. \n\n_Image sourced from Pixabay_'
 'German automaker Volkswagen Group and Amazon Web Services (AWS), part of **Amazon.com, Inc.  **(NASDAQ:AMZN), announced a multi-year global agreement to create the Volkswagen Industrial Cloud, a cloud-based industrial digital production platform.\n\nVolkswagen\'s primary motive is to streamline data coming from its different manufacturing and logistics processes, create actionable information through machine learning and data analytics, and use that information to increase factory efficiency and uptime, improve production flexibility and increase vehicle quality.\n\nThough Amazon is primarily known for its ecommerce platform, the company has been continually expanding its services beyond online retail. AWS generates a significant portion of its revenue today. Initially, AWS was envisioned as a platform to help Amazon standardize and automate its retail computing infrastructure. However, over the years it has evolved to provide virtual servers as a service to businesses.\n\nFor the Volkswagen Group, it makes sense to centralize all the data it derives from its operations by pushing it to the cloud. Real-time data fed into the cloud from 122 manufacturing facilities around the world will help Volkswagen manage the overall effectiveness of assembly equipment, while also tracking parts and vehicles.\n\n"The Volkswagen Group, with its global expertise in automobile production, and AWS, with its technological know-how, complement each other extraordinarily well. With our global industry platform we want to create a growing industrial ecosystem with transparency and efficiency bringing benefits to all concerned," said Oliver Blume, a member of the board of management of Volkswagen Aktiengesellschaft.\n\nAWS comes with a variety of Internet of Things (IoT) services that include IoT Greengrass, IoT Core, IoT Analytics and IoT SiteWise. The Amazon statement explained these services can "detect, collect, organize and run sophisticated analytics on data from the plant floor." Using these solutions, Volkswagen can understand operational trends, identify gaps in production and streamline processes to reduce waste.\n\nAndy Jassy, CEO of AWS, stated that Volkswagen\'s industrial cloud would reinvent its manufacturing and logistics processes, and the automaker\'s collaboration with AWS will have a profound impact on efficiency and quality of production throughout Volkswagen\'s global supply chain.\n\nApart from Volkswagen, the BMW Group is also using AWS for its connected car application, using the cloud to collect sensor data from BMW Series 7 cars and to give drivers dynamically updated map information. BMW\'s car-as-a-sensor (CARASSO) service leverages AWS tools to adapt to rapidly changing load requirements that can scale up and down as needed.\n\nGoing forward, cloud services like AWS may be an integral part of vehicle manufacturing, as original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) are inching towards a vehicle-as-a-service outlook. Automakers will be able to offer continued services to consumers even after the vehicles are sold.\n\nThe development of autonomous driving technology will also need cloud storage as driving data will be required for machine learning algorithms to get better at understanding real-time driving environments. Even after full-fledged automation is commercially deployed, cloud technology will be necessary to streamline and make sense of all the data for a seamless transit experience and to protect the vehicle from hackers.\n\nImage Sourced From Facebook\n\nWant more content like this?

 'Ride-hailing company Lyft will see its shares trade on a public market for the first time Friday. Ahead of the much-anticipated IPO, the following is a roundup of what industry experts are saying. \n\n### Lyft Investor Sees Amazon-Like Story\n\nLyft\'s story remains in its early stages and is comparable to **Amazon.com, Inc.** (NASDAQ:AMZN)\'s origins in the 1990s, David Chao, co-founder and general partner of DCM and a Lyft investor told CNBC Thursday.\n\nAmazon\'s true potential reach has only been felt recently, and it could take decades for Lyft to reach its full potential, he said. \n\nLyft can "double or even triple" its margins over the long-term from the advancement of autonomous vehicles, Chao said. \n\n### Chicago Treasurer Talks Dual Class Structure\n\nLyft\'s IPO will come with a dual class structure, which implies the founders will maintain considerable voting power.\n\nWhile it is not necessarily uncommon for companies to have a dual-class structure, what is unique is the lack of a sunset provision, Chicago Treasurer Kurt Summers told CNBC.\n\nA sunset provision is a form of good corporate governance and aligns interests between all parties, he said.\n\nChicago is home to 57,000 ride-hailing drivers and just 4,000 taxi operators, Summers said. \n\nLyft is an "important part of our transportation mix," and a dual-class listing does raise questions related to the "sustainability of their future of a company and their business operations," the city treasurer said. \n\n### Cyndx CEO: \'Home Run\' Potential\n\nFriday\'s "opening day" ceremony for Lyft could result in a "home run" performance, Cyndx CEO Jim McVeigh also told CNBC in an interview.\n\nLyft is a company that boasts large engagement with consumers and transforming industries, the CEO said. Once a company like Lyft controls the customer engagement, it can add on new services and drivers of revenue to generate profit over the long-term, he said. \n\n"When you think about transportation being a $1.2-trillion opportunity, at [Lyft\'s 2018] $2 billion of revenue -- that\'s nothing."\n\n_Related Links:_\n\n_Recode Editor: Uber, Lyft\'s Business \'Tough Going From A Financial Point Of View\'_\n\n_Cramer, DataTrek\'s Colas Talk Lyft Ahead Of Anticipated IPO_\n\n_Photo courtesy of Lyft.  _\n\nBuckingham\'s bullish stance on **Five Below Inc** (NASDAQ:FIVE) remains unchanged after the company\'s fourth-quarter results, a stance KeyBanc doesn\'t agree with.\n\n### The Analysts\n\nBuckingham Research Group\'s Bob Summers maintains a Buy rating on Five Below with a price target lifted from $135 to $145.\n\nKeyBanc Capital Markets\' Bradley Thomas maintains at Sector Weight.\n\n### Buckingham: Momentum Across All Metrics\n\nFive Below\'s earnings showed continued momentum across all relevant metrics, Summers said in a research report. Most notably, EPS of $1.59 beat expectations of $1.57 per share while comparable store sales of 4.4 percent beat the consensus estimate of 4.2 percent.\n\nManagement\'s full-year 2019 EPS guidance of $3.00 to $3.07 fell short of consensus estimates of $3.13, but Summers said management did a "good job" of explaining the shortfall. Specifically, management explained multiple transitory cost pressures ahead which helped investors "look through the noise."\n\nAdjusting for cost pressures along with accounting changes and a new distribution center, the 2019 guidance would have come in-line with expectations.\n\nSo long as Five Below continues to show strong unit economics, positive comps, and unit growth investors will "remain relatively valuation insensitive," Summers wrote.\n\n_See Also:  Five Below\'s Ability To \'Comp The Comp\' Earns An Upgrade_\n\n### KeyBanc: Valuation Concerns\n\nFive Below\'s quarter shows the company\'s momentum is broad-based and not just limited to toys and games, Thomas said in a research report. The company remains among the most compelling growth stories in retail space as it operates as a "defensible tween discount niche."\n\nIn fact, Thomas said Five Below offers value that\'s "not replicated" at **Amazon.com, Inc.** (NASDAQ:AMZN) since the retailer works with manufacturers for its own products that sell below $5. The company\'s positioning is expected to translate to annual store growth rate in the high-teens to 20 percent, 20 percent average annual sales growth, and similar net income growth rates through 2020.\n\nShares of Five Below are trading at 39.3 times 2019 estimated EPS and 31.6 times 2020 EPS, respectively. This compares to a five-year average forward P/E of 32 times, so the stock\'s premium valuation warrants a neutral stance at this time.\n\n### Price Action\n\nShares of Five Below were trading higher by 6.6 percent at $127.96 Thursday afternoon.\n\n_Photo credit:Mike Mozart, Flickr_'
 'The cannabis world received mixed news last week. On the one hand, the House Financial Services Committee voted in favor of a bill that would allow marijuana businesses to work with banks and credit unions, the SAFE Banking Act, allowing it to advance to the House floor. On the other hand, the state of New Jersey cancelled its vote on a bill that would legalize recreational cannabis due to a lack of support from legislators.\n\n"There have been so many advancements in cannabis, that many in the industry just feel like there will be no barriers in the way," Debra Borchard, CEO of Green Market Report, told Benzinga. "However, New Jersey was a good reminder that there are still lots of people with concerns. It\'s still an infant industry with a long way to go."\n\nCommenting on the SAFE Banking Act, Kyle Detwiler, CEO of Northern Swan Holdings said, "This is a great step forward for the industry as a whole, and this should improve efficiency and worker safety… We hope this is a stepping stone towards full legalization which will allow greater competition, product innovation and patient health."\n\n**_The Cannabis Capital Conference is coming back to Toronto April 17-18!_**\n\nMorgan Fox, spokesperson for the National Cannabis Industry Association (NCIA), noted that, "The strong bipartisan support for the SAFE Banking Act in this committee is a good sign of how it will perform when it comes up for a vote on the floor of the House. The legal cannabis industry isn\'t going anywhere, and as more states regulate cannabis it is increasingly important that it be able to access financial services for the safety of businesses and their employees, to increase transparency, and to make more capital available to small businesses and communities that have been most harmed by prohibition."\n\n**_Follow_**** _@BZCannabis_**** _  on Twitter for up-to-date news and stories on cannabis, hemp and CBD._**\n\n### **Marijuana Stocks & ETFs**\n\nOver the last five trading days, the **Horizons Marijuana Life Sciences Index ETF** (OTC:HMLSF) (TSE:HMMJ) lost 3.8 percent, while the **ETFMG Alternative Harvest ETF**(NYSE:MJ) tumbled 1.25 percent.

Heffernan, who previously held tenured positions at **Procter & Gamble Co **(NYSE:PG) and **Mondelez International** (NASDAQ:MDLZ)\'s Cadbury Schweppes, will fully manage revenue sales streams and will be responsible for overseeing all sales activities.\n\n"I am very excited to be joining the Ignite team and driving the company\'s mission to become the first global super-premium cannabis and CBD brand. I\'m thrilled to have the opportunity to work with Ignite\'s top tier management team and leverage my experience to grow the Ignite brand within an industry that is primed for explosive growth," said Heffernan in a press release.\n\nThe U.S. subsidiary of **iAnthus Capital Holdings**announced the acquisition of CBD For Life, a national brand of CBD products, in an all-stock deal valued at  $13.7 million.\n\n**Cronos Group** reported 250-percent revenue growth for the fourth quarter, albeit amidst a big net loss.\n\n**Canopy Growth** announced a collaboration with actor Seth Rogen and his writing partner Evan Goldberg, to launch an adult-use cannabis cultivation brand, Houseplant.\n\n**Feals** launched a "digitally-native" CBD and wellness brand focused on delivering the highest-quality, premium CBD right to consumers\' doorsteps. The company seeks to usher a new approach to the far-reaching benefits of this powerhouse ingredient to the masses with a D2C platform that brings quality ingredients, transparent sourcing practices, and an education and data-backed conversational commerce hotline to show customers a better way to feel better using CBD.\n\n"Our hemp is hand harvested from family farms in CO and Oregon following organic farming practices. We take a conscious approach to every Feals product made, providing only pure, high quality ingredients and third party testing every step of the way," said co-founder Drew Todd.\n\nMicrocap**Applied DNA Sciences Inc** (NASDAQ:APDN) closed up 32 percent Friday after the company announced a new cannabis tracking deal with cannabis consultancy **TheraCann****.**\n\nCalifornia-based **Grupo Flor** developed what it claims is the cannabis industry\'s first commodity trading desk, to connect buyers and sellers for the purchase and sale of raw cannabis materials. Traders began using the platform this month in the California THC market, executing several million dollars worth of trades. The desk rapidly expanded into the national CBD market using the company\'s established network of farmers in Colorado, Kentucky, North Carolina, South Carolina and West Virginia, and will soon add Colombia as the first international sourcing pipeline.\n\n"We created a more efficient exchange for buyers and sellers by solving two critical problems," said Grupo Flor CEO Paul Henderson. "Buyers are sourcing raw materials from an array of entities and many of the products are inconsistent and unreliable. On the flip side, these sellers don\'t have the support and logistics infrastructure to efficiently sell and transport their product. We believe this trading platform is a win-win for the entire industry."\n\n**Shineco Inc**(NASDAQ:TYHT) announced a partnership with **Heilongjiang Zhenye Agricultural Technology Development Co.** to construct the largest planting and processing base for industrial hemp in China. A potential acquisition of Zhenye Agricultural is also in the books.\n\nThe **Minority Cannabis Business Association (MCBA)** announced plans to score the effectiveness of social equity policies recently implemented by the city of Los Angeles, which are designed to help communities, families and individuals who have been harmed by the War on Drugs. Years of systemic racism, harsh drug sentencing laws, and disproportionate policing have all heavily contributed to the detriment of communities of color and social equity programs are designed to reinvest in those communities and help those most harmed with entering the industry.\n\nThe case study utilizes an "Equity Equation," which provides a grading system to rate the effectiveness of municipal social equity programs based on several separate factors that have been determined to play a major role in the success or failure of these policies. While these social equity programs are being implemented in cities across the country, their intended outcomes are often not being met.\n\nOne factor commonly cited as a barrier to entry for people of color to find a place in the cannabis industry, regardless of policies in place, is a lack of available capital. A similar equity study was recently conducted in Oakland, Sacramento and San Francisco, and will soon be conducted in Denver. The goal is to reexamine those policies and to revise them until they meet those intended outcomes in an effort to develop an effective and repeatable model.\n\n"As is the case with any policy in this country, if it\'s not working to meet its intended outcome, we must revisit it and rework it unit it does," said Kayvan Khalatbari, MCBA Board Chair. "The same is true for these social equity policies in the cannabis industry which, to be fair, are being implemented for the first time in history so it\'s easy to understand why they aren\'t perfect out the gate. We do need to hold them accountable though, because these communities that for decades have been thrown under the bus by the War on Drugs deserve it.\n\n"L.A.\'s equity program doesn\'t just affect communities of color in that city, but in cities across the country that will look to L.A. as an example of how to implement their own programs. We must get this right, and this case study is intended to encourage that investigation and ongoing conversation."\n\n**CannTrust** posted record fourth-quarter revenue, but still fell short of analyst expectations.\n\n**Vireo Health International**(OTC:VREOF) announced its expansion into two new medical marijuana markets.\n\nOn Monday, Vireo announced its acquisition of Arizona Natural Remedies, a vertically integrated operator with a dispensary in Phoenix. On Thursday, Vireo followed that announcement by disclosing their second acquisition of the week, this time in New Mexico. In New Mexico, Vireo purchased Red Barn, a holder of one of New Mexico\'s medical cannabis licenses and owner of dispensaries in Santa Fe and Gallup.\n\n"Vireo is excited to expand our operations into the Southwest region. Arizona and New Mexico\'s well-established medical cannabis markets present us with fantastic opportunities to help more patients," CEO Kyle Kingsley told Benzinga.

The line consists of 10 over-the-counter pain relief products, including solutions for sports-related joint and muscle pain, back and neck pain, arthritis-related pain, stiffness and swelling, and muscle and joint pain.

The move came just one week after **CVS Health Corp** (NYSE:CVS) made a similar announcement.\n\nMedical cannabis health care network **Compassionate Certification Centers**  forged a partnership with **MarijuanaDoctors.com** to distribute a co-branded line of CBD products. THC-free and made in the U.S., the CBD line contains premium botanical oils made from organic, all-natural ingredients.

The website has become one of the fastest growing platforms in cannabis, and besides providing a protected content hub catered to an adult demographic, it is the first video-based social network to provide monetization options to cannabis influencers and to offer cannabis companies commercial-style advertising.\n\n**GrowLife Inc.**(OTC:PHOT), an indoor cultivation product and service providers, announced the launch of a subscription service for consumable cloning supplies as part of its EZ-Clone commercial propagation equipment line. Through its e-logistics platform, commercial cannabis and hemp cultivators will be able to subscribe to monthly shipments that include all of the products necessary to clone plants.\n\n"We have observed a spike in demand for commercial cloning systems and this subscription service allows us to service these customers without additional overhead cost," said GrowLife Executive Vice President of Sales and Marketing Joe Barnes. "This subscription service allows us to offer the best price on these packages while creating a strong consumer base. Specifically, hemp cultivators are turning to cloning as a way to meet production goals with healthy and consistent plants."\n\n**Driven Deliveries Inc.**(OTC:DRVD), announced a new cannabis delivery model, Driven Direct, which will mirror **Amazon.com, Inc.**(OTC:AMZN)\'s delivery model. The company will initially launch Driven Direct in highly-populated cities across California.\n\nCannabis retailers are eager to establish last-mile delivery for their products to reach more consumers across the state. Driven aims to solve this unmet need by providing a reliable cannabis delivery platform with the company\'s current and future retail partners, as well as name brands who want to deliver their products directly to the consumer.  \n\n"As we continue to scale our business by expanding our partnerships with cannabis retailers across California, we are confident that Driven Direct\'s last-mile delivery will become a constantly used service," Chris Boudreau, CEO of Driven Deliveries, told Benzinga. "We aim to benefit local cannabis retailers and consumers."\n\n**Helix TCS, Inc** (OTCQB:HLIX)\'s leading seed to sale and cannabis point of sale company, **BioTrackTHC,** received a one-year contract extension to continue providing Hawaii\'s medical cannabis tracking system until June 30, 2020, which oversees the state\'s entire cannabis supply-chain. The company operates nine government cannabis tracking contracts across seven states, Puerto Rico, and the city of Arcata, California, and announced a two-year extension to the Delaware cannabis tracking contract just two weeks ago.\n\n"This extension is yet another testament to our ability to effectively manage legal cannabis programs, with this being our 2nd government contract extension this month and 3rd overall," said Zachary L. Venegas, Executive Chairman and CEO of Helix TCS. "We look forward to playing a critical role in onboarding new legal cannabis programs and ensuring smooth expansions to existing programs."\n\nFlow Kana launched a its Limited Edition 2018 Emerald Cup Winner Collection, featuring six award winning, organic, sungrown micro-batches from the master cultivars of 2018. BDS Analytics\' sales data shows that California consumers continue to prefer sungrown cannabis from the Emerald Triangle region where the area\'s rich soil and Mediterranean climate are to cannabis what the geology of the Napa Valley is to wine. Flow Kana Limited Edition will be available at California retailers by mid-April.\n\n**Cresco Labs  **(OTC:CRLBF) said it had been pre-qualified for a cultivation and processing license by Michigan\'s Department of Licensing and Regulatory Affairs Medical Marijuana Licensing Board.\n\nColorado-based software development company **Best In Grow** launched its cannabis retail management solution.

The report forecasted the continent\'s CBD market is expected to grow $1.7 billion by 2023, with its 2019-2023 CAGR totaling 42 percent.\n\nThe **Drug Policy Alliance (DPA)** revealed it was the force behind the viral campaign for the **Country Club Cannabis (CCC),**  a private social club seemingly for the 1 percent. DPA partnered with creative agency Virtue for the thought-provoking campaign with the tagline _Legalize It Right,_ which was conceived to educate the public on the inequity of marijuana laws.\n\nThe satirical "Club" boasted dress and hairstyling guidelines and a vetting system for applicants which included criminal background and credit checks - drawing attention to the importance of prioritizing equity and repairing the harms of mass criminalization. The campaign also highlighted the need for New York State\'s proposed cannabis legislation to include a meaningful equitable program so that a vacuum is not created for the fake Country Club Cannabis to become a reality. Those measures include:\n\n  * **Automatically clear criminal records** and address the devastating impacts of prohibition on immigration and family law, housing and employment;\n  * **Ensure an equitable and diverse industry** by having an equity program from the outset, supporting small businesses and farmers over large corporations, and providing real banking and capital solutions; and\n  * Use revenue from marijuana legalization to **reinvest in communities** that have been most impacted by criminalization.\n\n\n\nA recent study conducted by biopharma company, **GB Sciences Inc**(OTC:GBLX), showed only three** ** chemical varieties of cannabis were sold in the Nevada dispensaries between January of 2016 and June of 2017, despite nearly 400 different "strain names" appearing on product packaging. What consumers see is not what they get, the company warned.\n\n"There is no protection for patients from inadvertent or intentional mislabeling of cannabis strains. Many cannabis samples with vastly different chemical profiles were labeled with identical strain names. And identical samples were often labeled with a huge variety of strain names," said Dr. Andrea Small-Howard, CSO of GB Sciences in a press release.\n\n### **Events Calendar**\n\nMarch 29-30: The **NoCo Hemp Expo** will gather hemp industry people at the Crowne Plaza DIA Convention Center in Denver.

But it\'s not what you think. This is a **Cannabis Industry Associates Meet Up**.\n\n"I was new to the cannabis industry and wondered what others did in the space so I started a monthly networking group on Meet Up called CIA about a year and a half ago.

Featured speakers include Eaze CEO Jim Patterson, Pax CEO Bharat Vasan, and Dosist CEO Gunner Winston, with more to be announced. CannTech is scheduled for May 7th in San Francisco.\n\n"We\'ve been optimistic about the cannabis industry for a while now, starting with our seed round investment in Eaze in 2014 which made DCM the first firm on Sand Hill Road to get in the space. We created CannTech to be a launchpad for emerging cannabis professionals to get funded, educated, and connected, and we\'re excited to hear the \'big ideas\' brought to the table," said Kyle Lui, Partner at DCM.\n\nMay 28 - June 1: **The Cons** is a gathering of three trade and fan shows, the Cam Con, the Cannabis Con, and the Inked Con, all under one roof, at the SLS South Beach Hotel in Miami Beach, Florida.

"Being steps away from the U.S. Capitol, where we have witnessed an influx of women assuming leadership positions, is sure to inspire our community as a whole to connect, educate, and empower female leaders in this space."\n\nTraveling: **CBD Expo Tour** is kicking off. The events feature more than 70 exhibitors, along with a substantial lineup of speaker presentations and panel discussions from experts in the research, production, globalization, and sale of CBD products.\n\n"We\'re taking it into a hard working area of America where the population is seeking natural pain relief. We will be continuing to educate on the benefits of CBD wellness and why the pharmaceutical companies, as well as the FDA\'s suppression efforts are self-serving," said Celeste Miranda, Founder of CBD Expo Tour and CEO of MACE Media.\n\n_Photo by  _Javier Hasse_ _.__']
