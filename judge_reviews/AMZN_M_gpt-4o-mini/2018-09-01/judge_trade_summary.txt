Based on the provided market data and news, predict the LLMâ€™s decision:
News Factors Considered:
['There\'s been a lot of sympathy trading in the retail space this earnings season, as investors look for any signs of the unpredictable retail sector\'s trajectory in the **Amazon.com, Inc.** (NASDAQ:AMZN) era. In the near-term, it seems as though the market sees **Walmart Inc**(NYSE:WMT) and **Macy \'s Inc **(NYSE:M) as the two bellwethers of the brick-and-mortar retail group.\n\n### Sympathy Trades\n\nLast Thursday, a big earnings beat from Walmart sent the stock soaring 9.2 percent on the day. In response, shares of **Target Corporation** (NYSE:TGT), **Kroger Co**(NYSE:KR) and **Costco Wholesale Corporation** (NASDAQ:COST) all traded higher on the day as well. All of the stocks share one common trait: they are grocery companies looking to fend of competition from Amazon\'s Whole Foods.\n\nAt the same time, Macy\'s stock plummeted 15.8 percent on the day of its earnings report. **Kohl \'s Corporation** (NYSE:KSS), **J.C. Penney Company Inc** (NYSE:JCP), **Sears Holdings Corp** (NASDAQ:SHLD) and **Dillard \'s, Inc**. (NYSE:DDS) all traded down by more than 5 percent on the day in sympathy. Once again, this group has a common bond: they\'re mall retailers fighting against online competition from Amazon.\n\n### Mixed Bag\n\nOverall, it has been a very mixed bag for retail stocks this earnings season. Despite abysmal performances from Macy\'s, Dillard\'s, J.C. Penney and Sears, the **SPDR S &P Retail (ETF)** (NYSE:XRT) is actually up 2.3 percent in the past month. Large gains from grocers Kroger, Walmart and Target have helped support the sector overall. And of course Amazon stock is up 3.4 percent in that time.\n\nAmazon has created a lot of chaos for retail companies and investors in recent years. Until Wall Street gets a clearer picture of Amazon\'s long-term impact on the retail industry, investors will likely continue to look to retail leaders like Macy\'s and Walmart for signs of where the rest of the sector is headed.\n\n_Related Links:_\n\n_Good News For Retail Investors _\n\n_How The Toys\'R\' Us Bankruptcy Impacted July\'s Jobs Data_\n\n_Photo by Fastily/Wikimedia.  _\n\n**Nike Inc** (NASDAQ:NKE) may be stealing market share back from **adidas AG (ADR)** (OTC:ADDY), according to a new report from Susquehanna. \n\n### Analyst: Nike On Track For $50B In Revenue By 2023\n\nSusquehanna\'s Sam Poser upgraded Nike from Neutral to Positive and raised the price target from $78 to $93.\n\nImproved product offerings and product flow are leading Nike to market share gains from adidas and athletic specialty retailers **Foot Locker, Inc.** (NYSE:FL) Finish Line and**Hibbett Sports, Inc.**(NASDAQ:HIBB), as well as the family footwear channel, Poser said in the upgrade note.\n\n"Based on our proprietary checks with retailers, and with some of Nike\'s competitors, it has become clear, after some concern on our end, that Nike is beginning to balance scale and scarcity well, across the spectrum of retail partners and across merchandise categories," the analyst said. \n\nBetter retailers are beginning to recognize that Nike\'s innovative products are taking share from Adidas, which is rapidly decelerating, Poser said. Adidas\' brand reported 12-percent sales growth in its second-quarter report in early August. \n\nNike is on pace to hit $50 billion in revenue by 2023, the analyst said; the company initially set the target in 2015 to be completed by 2020.\n\nNike apparel is gaining significant momentum in the lifestyle and performance categories despite the recent resurgence of Champion and Fila, Poser said. Nike basketball sell-through rates are increasing, and new signature shoes from Kyrie Irving, Kevin Durant, Kobe Bryant and LeBron James are driving positive year-over-year results.\n\n"We contend that the clean inventories in the marketplace, the growing DTC business and new innovative product will drive more full-price selling than guidance infers, primarily driven by the improvement in the North American market."\n\n### Piper Jaffray: Direct-To-Consumer Is Nike\'s Growth Driver \n\nPiper Jaffray analyst Erinn Murphy upgraded Nike from Neutral to Overweight and raised the price target from $72 to $93.\n\nWhile the last five years have been marked by outsized singular brand leadership, Murphy said she expects future years to be more balanced competitively. Over the past five years, Nike and adidas have driven greater than 40 percent of incremental category growth across North America, Western Europe and China, she said. \n\nBoth brands will contribute more evenly to overall category growth moving forward -- and Nike does not need to dominate the athletic narrative to drive strong growth, Murphy said. For Nike, it\'s direct-to-consumer growth that roughly doubles revenue per unit, the analyst said. \n\nAthletic brands, given their global scale and awareness, have much less of a chance "being disintermediated by **Amazon.com, Inc.**(NASDAQ:AMZN) than other consumer categories," Murphy said. \n\n### Price Action:\n\nNike shares were trading up more than 3 percent to $82.18 at the time of publication Monday. \n\n_Related Links:_\n\n_Burberry Moves For A Comeback Amid A Renaissance In Luxury Brands_\n\n_Cowen: Columbia Sportswear\'s Share Price Doesn\'t Reflect Portfolio Strength_\n\n_Photo courtesy of Nike._'
 'Retail earnings make it clear there are at least two "resurrection stories," according to CNBC\'s Jim Cramer.\n\n### Walmart: Not Too Late To Buy\n\nShares of **Walmart Inc** (NYSE:WMT) soared last week, as CEO Doug McMillon\'s turnaround plan continues to show momentum despite being in its third year, Cramer said during his daily "Mad Money" show Monday. While there have been some bumps in the road, including February\'s earnings miss, McMillon insisted growth would pick up again, Cramer said. \n\nThursday\'s earnings report is "sweet vindication" for investors who believed in Walmart, the CNBC host said. The numbers speak for themselves, including a 40-percent rise in online sales, which makes Walmart "probably the only retailer with [the] scale" to challenge **Amazon.com, Inc.** (NASDAQ:AMZN), he said. \n\nWalmart\'s stock is trading at 19 times next year\'s earnings estimates, which is a notable discount to fellow retailer **Costco Wholesale Corporation** (NASDAQ:COST), which trades at 29 times next year\'s estimates, Cramer said. Walmart\'s stock is only starting to bridge the gap with rival retailers, but if growth continues to accelerate, it will command even higher earnings multiples, he said. \n\n"I think this $96 stock can go to $115 or $120 in the not-too-distant future," Cramer said. "Meaning, Walmart stock is still a buy."\n\n### Nordstrom: The \'Right Call\' Was Made\n\nWalmart isn\'t the only "miraculous retail resurrection" story, as **Nordstrom, Inc.** (NYSE:JWN)\'s Friday earnings report was akin to a "rise from the grave like Lazarus," Cramer said during his "Mad Money" show.\n\nNordstrom shares spiked more than 10 percent after the Q2 print. Similar to Walmart, the numbers speak for themselves, as same-store sales grew by 4 percent and management lifted its full-year guidance across nearly every metric.\n\nNordstrom\'s success can also be attributed to a strategy over the years of spending a "fortune to upgrade everything," Cramer said. Friday\'s report shows this was the "right call," he said. \n\n"I think we\'re looking at a wave of upgrades, which tend to push stocks higher." \n\n_Related Links:_\n\n_3 Retailers Jim Cramer Says Are Winners In A Volatile Sector_\n\n_Earnings Show That As Macy\'s And Walmart Go, So Goes Retail_\n\n_Public domain photo via Wikimedia.  _\n\nIn the wake of **Netflix, Inc.**(NASDAQ:NFLX) shares retreating on the streaming service\'s second-quarter results, which revealed a miss on subscriber numbers and a Q3 subscriber count shortfall, William Blair reviewed the prospects for the company in the second half of 2018. \n\n### The Analyst\n\nAnalyst Ralph Schackart has an Outperform rating for the  shares of Netflix.\n\n### The Thesis\n\nStreet estimates point to a mere 7-percent increase in  Netflix\'s international net adds in the second half of 2018, as opposed to the four-year average increase of 43 percent, Schackart said in a Tuesday note. (See the analyst\'s track record here.) \n\nThe analyst forecast at least 10-percent upside, basing his estimate on "the library advantage internationally, history of recovery following lumpiness in business and a solid originals slate."\n\nThe  company  is increasing its number of foreign originals from 10 in the third quarter of 2017 to 19 in the third quarter of 2018  while also increasing the number of sequels, Schackart said. The healthy Q3 slate featuring in-country originals could lead to a strong quarter, he said. \n\nComparing Netflix\'s total library size to OTT peers in 15 countries, Schackart said the company\'s catalog is compelling. Although **Amazon.com, Inc.**(NASDAQ:AMZN)\'s library continues to grow, the analyst said it still trails Netflix in most regions.\n\nWilliam Blair expects an international subscriber count of 130 million for Netflix in 2020, above the consensus of 123.5 million. The international segment should reach 42-percent penetration by 2025, below the 60 percent the company achieved 16 years after its domestic launch, Schackart said. \n\nWilliam Blair\'s 2025 EPS valuation framework implies 20-percent upside in the next 12 months and a $660 share price by 2024.\n\n### The Price Action\n\nNotwithstanding the 18-percent drop since the company reported Q2 results after the close July 16, Netflix shares are still up about 71 percent year-to-date.\n\nThe stock was trading up 3.32 percent to $338.60 at the time of publication Tuesday. \n\n_Related Links:_\n\n_Which Is The Better Buy: Netflix Or China\'s Fast-Growing Iqiyi? _\n\n_Netflix Has\'Unstoppable Lead\' In Streaming TV, But Valuation Sends Loop Capital To Sideline _'
 'The S&P 500\'s bull run reached a record duration of 3,453 days on Wednesday, and CNBC analyst Jim Cramer said the market had to overcome obstacles to reach this point. \n\n"I think it\'s important to try to learn from this epic run," Cramer said Tuesday. "When you analyze a bull market, you need to realize that it\'s constantly climbing a wall or worry covered in barbed wire and cut glass."\n\nOn Tuesday\'s "Mad Money," Cramer named 10 negative catalysts that he said could have derailed the bull market since March 2009:\n\n**1\\. Skepticism.**\n\nThe bull market has had doubters since the beginning. Cramer said bull markets tend to die when investors are too euphoric over stocks.\n\n**2\\. High Valuations.**\n\nJust when it seemed as if earnings multiples were becoming prohibitively high, corporate tax cuts gave earnings numbers a major shot in the arm.\n\n**3\\. Political Turmoil.**\n\nWhether it be gridlock in Congress, government shutdowns, international trade wars or major health care reforms, the S&P 500 trudged higher through it all.\n\n**4\\. The Federal Reserve.**\n\nThroughout the first few years of the rally, critics said the Fed was artificially inflating stock prices via its quantitative easing program. Now that interest rates have started to tick higher, the rally has continued.\n\n**5\\. U.S. Debt Downgrade.**\n\nCramer said the 2011 S&P downgrade of U.S. government debt from AAA to AA+ was been one of the darkest moments in the bull market.\n\n**6\\. Industry Bear Markets.**\n\nDespite uninterrupted gains in the market as a whole, bear markets in housing, oil and semiconductors have weighed on overall returns.\n\n**7\\. European Debt Worries.**\n\nThe U.S. economy has been steady throughout the rally, but economic crises in Greece, Italy and Turkey have all threatened the stability of the European economy.\n\n**8\\. China Concerns.**\n\nConcern over an economic slowdown in China was the driving force behind the steep S&P 500 sell-off in 2015. Today, the ongoing U.S. trade war with China is a brand new threat to the bull market.\n\n**9\\. Inverted Yield Curve.**\n\nAn inverted yield curve -- in which yields on two-year Treasury bonds surpass yields on 10-year Treasury bonds -- has historically been a reliable indicator of a recession, and the yield curve has been relatively flat in recent quarters.\n\n**10\\. FAANG Valuations.**\n\n**Facebook, Inc.  **(NASDAQ:FB), **Amazon.com, Inc.** (NASDAQ:AMZN), **Apple, Inc.** (NASDAQ:AAPL), **Netflix, Inc.** (NASDAQ:NFLX) and **Alphabet Inc  **(NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) have collectively accounted for a huge chunk of the U.S. market gains throughout the bull market, and Cramer said most market analysts now see the group as overvalued.\n\nDespite the obstacles, the S&P 500 has kept on truckin\' in 2018. The **SPDR S &P 500 ETF Trust** (NYSE:SPY) is up another 7.3 percent year-to-date.\n\n_Related Links:_\n\n_Is Your Stock Portfolio\'Too Long\'?_\n\n_Q2 13F Roundup: How Buffett, Einhorn, Loeb And Others Adjusted Their Portfolio_\n\nThree of the best-performing tech stocks since the market low of March 2009 are **Netflix, Inc.** (NASDAQ:NFLX), **Amazon.com, Inc.** (NASDAQ:AMZN) and **Nvidia Corporation** (NASDAQ:NVDA). If investors were to pick one to hold over the next 3,500 days, which would it be?\n\n### The Analyst\n\nOppenheimer\'s Ari Wald and Blue Line Futures President Bill Baruch discussed Netflix, Amazon and Nvidia during a recent CNBC "Trading Nation" segment.\n\n### The Thesis\n\nShares of Netflix, Amazon and Nvidia are up 5,825, 3,002 and 2,886 percent, respectively, since March 9, 2009. Among the three names, one stands out as a near-term opportunity to buy for the long-term: Netflix.\n\nNetflix\'s stock has come under pressure in recent weeks, Wald said. The stock\'s sell-off comes at a time when the 200-day moving average has been rising since 2016. In addition, the stock\'s 50-day retracement of its year-to-date gains offers investors "good support" around the $300 level, he said. \n\nBlue Line Futures\' Baruch agrees. A rally in Netflix\'s stock is imminent, as investors are getting over the recent earnings report and its "big, bad scary wolf" of a subscriber number miss, he said.\n\nThe streaming video company continues to produce new content, and the stock will return to its leader status this year, Baruch said. \n\n"You\'ll see this stock get back to its all-time high." \n\n### Price Action\n\nNetflix shares were up 1.88 percent at $344.38 at the time of publication Wednesday. \n\n_Related Links:_\n\n_Wall Street\'s Reaction To Netflix\'s Q2 Earnings Report_\n\n_Which Is The Better Buy: Netflix Or China\'s Fast-Growing Iqiyi?_\n\n_Photo courtesy of Netflix.  _\n\nWhen an exchange traded fund is just over a month old, it\'s too soon to pass judgment on that product. Thanks to compelling fundamental factors in their respective market niches, however, some new ETFs immediately have the look of winners.\n\nThat could be the case for the **ProShares Online Retail ETF** (NYSE:ONLN), which is just over a month old.\n\n### What Happened\n\nONLN follows the ProShares Online Retail Index. That cap-weighted benchmark "is designed to measure the performance of publicly traded companies that principally sell online or through other non-store channels, such as mobile or app purchases, rather than through bricks-and-mortar store locations," according to ProShares.\n\nAgain, an ETF that\'s barely more than a month old shouldn\'t be judged too favorably or harshly, but ONLN debuted on July 13 and by the end of last month had $4 million in assets under management. That number has since swelled to almost $6 million.\n\n### Why It\'s Important\n\nA slew of data points indicate online retail ETFs, such as ONLN, could be well-timed concepts.\n\n"Analysts expect the growth of online retail to continue. Today, about 10% of global retail sales are made online, which leaves a strategy such as ONLN\'s with tremendous room for growth. Recent data indicates that online sales growth could double by 2030," according to ProShares.\n\nLast month, the Commerce Department said online retail sales increased 3.9 percent in the second quarter from the first quarter.\n\nCiting Commerce Department data, ProShares points out that "the second quarter 2018 e-commerce estimate increased 15.2 percent (Â±4.2%) from the second quarter of 2017, while total retail sales increased 5.7 percent (Â±1.4%) in the same period."\n\nTraders doing some planning should keep in mind that third-quarter e-commerce sales data will be reported on Nov. 19, meaning ONLN could be trade-worthy around that report.\n\n### What\'s Next\n\nLong-term fundamental data auger well for ONLN, particularly if e-commerce sales in the U.S. and China meet and exceed estimates. Those two countries combine for about 97 percent of ONLN\'s geographic weight.\n\nAs such, those countries\' e-commerce titans dominate ONLN. **Amazon.com Inc.** (NASDAQ:AMZN) and **Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.**(NYSE:BABA) are by far ONLN\'s two largest holdings, combining for approximately 40 percent of the new ETF\'s weight.\n\n_Related Links:_\n\n_These New ETFs Are Already Huge_\n\n_Real Estate Rises In These ETFs_\n\n  * Stifel Nicolaus raised the price target for **Medtronic PLC** (NYSE:MDT) from $87 to $96.

 '**Deckers Outdoor Corporation** (NYSE:DECK) is reaping the benefits of improved management at UGG brand, according to a new analyst report.\n\n### The Analyst\n\nSusquehanna\'s Sam Poser upgraded Deckers from Negative to Neutral and raised his price target from $89 to $104.\n\n### The Thesis\n\nRecent industry checks indicate UGG brand management is beginning to achieve effective product segmentation, according to Poser. The analyst was previously negative on UGG, believing the decision to open up distribution to **Macy \'s Inc** (NYSE:M) and **Amazon.com, Inc.**(NASDAQ:AMZN) would hurt the brand. That doesn\'t appear to be the case.\n\n"We still believe that opening up UGG distribution to Macy\'s & Amazon was not a good decision, but it\'s appearing to be less harmful than we anticipated," Poser said in the note.\n\nPoser said improved management of the UGG brand along with strength from HOKA and Teva, reduces the downside risk of Decker\'s stock to less than 15 percent.\n\nAlthough Poser is more encouraged on Deckers, he said the company will need to materially beat and raise FY2019 guidance.\n\n"While there are opportunities for a beat & raise, as inventory in the marketplace is clean and HOKA is trending well, we believe the current share price reflects such good news, and inventory levels remain a concern of ours," he said. As a result, the analyst continues to see downside pressure on the stock price.\n\n### Price Action:\n\nDeckers shares were up about 2 percent Thursday at $121.40 per share.\n\n_Related Links:_\n\n_Urban Outfitters\' Record Q2: The Sell-Side\'s Take_\n\n_Gucci Dominates Luxury Resale, Hermes Fastest-Growing Brand Among Millennials_\n\nWith a merger of **CVS Health Corp.**(NYSE:CVS) and **Aetna Inc.**(NYSE:AET) pending regulatory approval, Cantor Fitzgerald downgraded the health insurer on valuation.  \n\n### The Analyst\n\nCantor Fitzgerald analyst Steven Halper downgraded Aetna from Overweight to Neutral with a price target of $202.\n\n### The Thesis\n\nAetna shares were trading at a 13-percent discount to their acquisition value in early May, but are now trading at a 4.6-percen discount, Halper said in the downgrade note.\n\nThis narrowed spread is likely a result of the increased probability of regulatory approval of the merger, the analyst said. \n\n"AET-CVS is a vertical merger, which is inherently difficult to challenge, but there remains some potential overlap in the Medicare Part D area. The two companies, in our opinion, should be able to find a remedy to satisfy regulatory concerns." \n\nThe acquisition would allow CVS the ability to continue its transformation to a health services company, as a new pharmacy network and pharmacy benefit manager would further complement AET\'s competitive positioning, Halper said.\n\nThe analyst said it\'s possible CVS views AET as a hedge against **Amazon.com Inc.**(NASDAQ:AMZN)\'s entry into the mail order pharmacy landscape.\n\n"Excluding the impact of the CVS merger, we continue to believe that 2018 is shaping up to be a transition year until the company\'s investments and improved Medicare Star ratings pay off in 2019," Halper said of Aetna. \n\n"We assume the combined company will pursue a more robust IT strategy, especially in the consumer engagement area. Beyond that, the pending merger with CVS seems logical, especially as other vertical mergers have been announced in the healthcare services industry."\n\n### Price Action\n\nAetna shares were down 0.40 percent at $196.97 at the time of publication Thursday.\n\n_Related Links:_\n\n_Analyst Lays Out Pros, Cons Of The CVS-Aetna Deal_\n\n_How A Walgreens-AmerisourceBergen Combo Stacks Up Against CVS-Aetna_'
 'The retail industry is perhaps the fastest-evolving industry in the last two decades. Part of this fast-paced evolution is the retail industry\'s unforgiving natural selection, weeding out companies that refuse to evolve or change with the times. History is littered with scores of retail brands that have faded away into oblivion because they were simply unable to transform and reinvent themselves. The likes of Sports Authority, Hollywood Video, HH Gregg, Borders Book Store, and Circuit City are some of the iconic brands that have gone extinct.\n\nInterestingly, tech firms such as **Amazon.com, Inc** (NASDAQ:AMZN),**Jet.com** (OTC:JTCMF), and **Alibaba Group Holdings, Ltd.** (NYSE:BABA) are currently exerting incredible market pressure on companies operating in the traditional retail landscape. The fact that Amazon successfully pulled off the acquisition of Whole Foods is further evidence of the inevitability of the tech-driven world of retail.\n\nWhile some bears are quick to make doomsday predictions about the wholesale death of the retail industry, but the fact remains that the retail industry is only staying true to its love for constant change. This piece provides insight into three emergent technologies that will continue to drive the evolution of retail within the next decade.\n\n### 1\\. Automation\n\nAutomation is an attractive siren to retailers - it gives them the lure of lower labor costs, happier customers, improved productivity, and better margins. The last couple of years has revealed some interesting attempts to automate retail processes. In May, Flippy, the hamburger-making robot resurfaced in a California chain after an original debut that lasted only one day in March. In China BingoBox has debuted as another interesting unmanned retail store similar to Amazon Go in the U.S. In fact, there\'s a rumor making the rounds that Microsoft is already in talks with Wal-Mart to make its own unmanned stores to stay competitive against Amazon.\n\n### 2\\. Blockchain Technology\n\nThe potential of blockchain technology to disrupt the retail industry can\'t be overemphasized, considering the huge volume of data that shoppers generate.\n\nShoping is helping retailers leverage blockchain technology to improve their competitiveness against tech driven competitors such as Amazon with its creation of the world\'s first decentralized shopper profile stored the blockchain. Shoping\'s app provides retailers with a universal shopper profile that facilitates an incredibly personal shopping experience on the retailers\' stores, apps, and websites based on their shopper preferences and their purchase history data.\n\nUsing blockchain technology, Shoping is able to ensure that shoppers maintain full control of their data by enabling them to choose what data to share with retailers. In sharing their shopping data, consumers are able to use a unified waitlist to shop in different places and to access faster checkout times without filling repetitive forms at checkout across all the stores where they shop. The retailers are also able to connect with their customers at a more personal and targeted level using data from previous purchases and personalization IQ games.\n\nThe best part is that using Shoping allows customers to be rewarded with cryptocurrencies for being a part of the data marketplace. The shoppers can redeem the token for gift cards which can be applied towards purchases among other uses.\n\n### 3\\. Artificial Intelligence\n\n  1. The retail industry has grown incredibly competitive, buyers are highly informed, and the barriers to adopting technology are increasingly being lowered.\n\n\n\n\nRetailers are starting to leverage artificial intelligence, accelerated analytics, and deep learning to get insights into the behavioral psychology of their customers. At the simplest level, artificial intelligence can help retailers identify a customers\' intent and then incentivizing the customer to take action that will result in a sale.\n\nBeyond facilitating increased sales, retailers can still leverage artificial intelligence to enable guide in-store navigations using voice recognition and onboard touch screen displays. AI could also help consumers connect their shopping activities with the Internet of Things for seamless ordering of supplies, parts, and services without any significant manual involvement.\n\nSecurity camera company **Arlo Technologies, Inc.**(NYSE:ARLO)\'s shares have been on the rise since its initial public offering earlier this month. \n\n### The Analysts\n\nImperial Capital analyst Saliq Khan initiated coverage of Arlo Technologies with an Outperform rating and $39 price target.\n\n### The Thesis\n\nIn the last 12 months, Arlo posted revenue of $441 million and an adjusted EBITDA of $19 million, Khan said in the initiation note. (See the analyst\'s track record here.) \n\nThe company provides over 8.6 million devices to 2.2 million registered users and controls 48 percent of the market, the analyst said. \n\nThe following factors drove Imperial\'s bullish stance, Khan said: \n\n  * Arlo\'s separation from **NetGear, Inc.**(NASDAQ:NTGR) should result in a sharpened focus on growth.\n  * An improved capital structure encourages the company to pursue strategic options.\n  * Arlo\'s distinct investment profile allows for direct investments in the company\'s future.\n\n\n\nThe security camera maker has growth opportunities in the form of annual upgrades, the improvement of customer "stickiness" and increased subscription revenue from Smart Services, Khan said. The analyst also suggested an expansion of Arlo\'s strategic partnerships.\n\n"The company currently sells its products through traditional and online retailers, wholesale distributors, broadcast channels, and wireless carriers" such as **AT &T Inc. **(NYSE:T), Khan said. \n\n"Although the company has benefited from a broad demand for smart home devices and Netgear\'s brand awareness, we believe Arlo will need to strategically collaborate with its retail partners to drive in-store (across its 20,000-plus retail locations) and online purchases."\n\nIn fiscal 2017, Arlo\'s largest retailers were **Best Buy Co Inc**(NYSE:BBY), accounting for 28 percent of revenue; **Amazon.com, Inc.** (NASDAQ:AMZN), which contributed 16 percent; and **Costco Wholesale Corporation**(NASDAQ:COST), which generated 13 percent of revenue, according to Imperial Capital. \n\n### Price Action\n\nArlo shares were slipping 4.3 percent to $22.08 at the time of publication Tuesday. \n\n_Related Links:_\n\n_Alarm.com Downgraded On Valuation By Imperial Capital_\n\n_Why Netgear Is Poised To Make A Run_\n\n_Photo courtesy of Arlo Technologies.  _'
 'Should **Roku Inc** (NASDAQ:ROKU) be concerned with reports **Amazon.com, Inc.** (NASDAQ:AMZN)\'s Internet Movie Database subsidiary may launch a rival streaming service? KeyBanc Capital Markets has a theory. \n\n### The Analyst\n\nKeyBanc Capital Markets\' Evan Wingren maintained an Overweight rating on Roku with a $67 price target and a Sector Weight rating on Amazon with no assigned price target. \n\n### The Thesis\n\nThe Information reported Tuesday that Amazon is exploring a free-to-use, advertising-supported video service that could be used on its Fire TV streaming video devices, Wingren said in a Wednesday note. (See the analyst\'s track record here.) \n\nAt the very least, the report is a "headline negative" for Roku, although the TV streaming business is large enough for both Roku and IMDB to be successful, the analyst said. \n\nRoku\'s ad business is estimated at around $200 million over the past year, while the linear TV ad business in the U.S. alone is more than $70 billion and more than $200 billion globally, Wingren said. Roku\'s stock is priced at 13 times 2019 EV/GP, which implies it doesn\'t have a dominant market share, he said.\n\nReports of competition from IMDB would have been an issue for Roku investors if the stock was trading at a valuation that implied market dominance, the analyst said. \n\nIMDB can create a "very compelling value proposition" to advertisers and execute well on a new product, Wingren said. This makes Amazon a high-quality competitor to Roku, but "there is plenty of room" for both companies to co-exist and drive value, he said. \n\n### Price Action \n\nRoku were trading lower by 3.84 percent Wednesday morning, while Amazon\'s stock was up 1.19 percent. \n\n_Related Links:_\n\n_Amazon, Best Buy Smart TV Partnership Hurts Roku_\n\n_What Alexa On Amazon\'s Fire TV Means For Netflix, Roku, Spotify, Comcast_\n\n_Photo courtesy of Roku.  _\n\n  * Morgan Stanley raised **Amazon.com, Inc.** (NASDAQ:AMZN) price target from $1,850 to $2,500.

The analyst also maintains an Overweight rating on Alphabet with a price target lifted from $1,325 to $1,515.\n\n### Amazon: Higher Margin Business In Focus\n\nAmazon\'s momentum has been evident over the past year and is highlighted by a beat on its EBIT guide by an average of 60 percent over the past three quarters, Nowak said in a note. Over the same time period, the company showed impressive growth in high-margin business lines like advertising, Amazon Web Services and subscriptions.\n\nAmazon\'s momentum is showing no signs of slowing down and should help the company\'s long-term profit to grow from $25 billion in 2018 GAAP EBIT to $45 billion by 2020, the analyst said. As such, the continued growth in the margin-rich business lines prompted Morgan Stanley to change its sum-of-the-parts price target higher as follows:\n\n  * 3P business: $950/share.\n  * AWS: $750/share.\n  * 1P business: $300/share.\n  * Advertising/Other: $250/share.\n  * Subscription: $200/share.\n  * Total Valuation: Approximately $2,500/share, or $1.2 trillion.\n\n\n\n### Alphabet: Bullish On New And Old Businesses\n\nThe bullish case for Alphabet is based on the continued belief Google\'s monetization of its more than one billion users across its multiple platforms is still in the early stages, Nowak said in the note. In fact, management is showing its dedication towards improving monetization by investing in new initiatives across Maps, hardware and YouTube subscriptions, among others.\n\nAlphabet\'s new business lines are in much earlier innings are undervalued in the stock\'s current valuation, Nowak said. Specifically, Alphabet\'s core business should be valued at $1,290 per share based on a 12 times multiple on 2020 EBITDA. As such, the stock assigns minimal value to other business lines, the most notable of which is Waymo which should be valued at $60 per share today.\n\nEven at a $45 billion valuation, Nowak said, Waymo is still undervalued based on the future prospects in the self-driving business (ride-sharing, logistics, licensing). Based on a 20-year discounted cash flow model, the Waymo business would warrant a $175 billion valuation over time. Over the medium-term, investors will better appreciate Waymo\'s prospects and be more comfortable with assigning higher valuations.\n\n### Price Action\n\nShares of Amazon were trading higher by 1.2 percent early Wednesday morning while Alphabet\'s stock was higher by 0.7 percent.\n\n_Related Links:_\n\n_\'Margins To The Rescue\' After Amazon Misses Q2 Sales Estimates_\n\n_Pro: Why Alphabet Is A Better Pick Than Facebook_'
 'In an environment favoring growth and momentum stocks and the corresponding exchange-traded funds, it may not be surprising to a fund such as the **iShares Edge MSCI USA Momentum Factor ETF** (CBOE:MTUM) thriving.\n\nStill, MTUM is racking up some impressive milestones.\n\n### What Happened\n\nOn the more superficial side of the ledger, MTUM recently surpassed $10 billion in assets under management, according to a Wednesday tweet from Martin Small, head of U.S. iShares. As of Aug. 28, MTUM, which turned five years old in April, had $10.05 billion in assets under management.\n\nThe ETF holds 124 stocks and targets the MSCI USA Momentum Index. That benchmark "is designed to reflect the performance of an equity momentum strategy by emphasizing stocks with high price momentum, while maintaining reasonably high trading liquidity, investment capacity and moderate index turnover," according to MSCI.\n\n### Why It\'s Important\n\nWhile the $10 billion milestone is impressive, more important is performance. MTUM is up nearly 16 percent year-to-date and was one of 165 ETFs to hit record highs on Wednesday.\n\nOver the past three years, MTUM is up 74.50 percent compared to "just" 55.4 percent for the S&P 500. Importantly, MTUM\'s annualized volatility of 13.7 percent over that period is just 140 basis points higher than the S&P 500\'s, indicating the momentum is delivering favorable risk/reward for investors. Over the past decade, the MSCI USA Momentum Index\'s standard deviation is only slightly higher than the MSCI USA Index.\n\nAs is the case with many momentum strategies, MTUM\'s current composition relies heavily on the technology and consumer discretionary sectors. Those groups combine for over 61 percent of the fund\'s weight. Financial services and industrial names combine for almost 23 percent.\n\n### What\'s Next\n\nAlthough MTUM is overly reliant on the FAANG stocks (just two are found among the ETF\'s top 10 holdings), further upside for **Amazon.com, Inc.** (NASDAQ:AMZN) will benefit MTUM because that stock is the fund\'s largest holding.\n\nOf MTUM\'s just over $10 billion in assets, $3.62 billion has flowed into the fund this year, making it one of 2018\'s top asset-gathering smart beta ETFs.\n\n_Related Links:_\n\n_A New Dynamic Multi-Factor ETF_\n\n_A New Way To Invest In Crypto_\n\nShares of **Amazon.com, Inc.** (NASDAQ:AMZN) traded north of $2,000 per share for the first time Thursday and are flirting with with a $1-trillion market cap. \n\nOne technical analyst is cautioning investors that the stock is more likely to move down than up and approach bear territory.\n\n### The Analyst\n\nMark Newton, a technical analyst at Newton Advisors, discussed Amazon\'s stock on CNBC.\n\n### The Thesis\n\nAmazon shares crossed the $2,000 threshold after the open Thursday. The stock needs to add around $30 billion in value to hit the $1-trillion market cap milestone.\n\nA look at the charts makes it difficult to justify continued upside, Newton said during a recent CNBC "Trading Nation" segment. \n\nAmazon\'s relative strength index -- a tool to measure if a stock is overbought or oversold -- stands at 89.5, which is the highest it has been since the late 1990s, the analyst said. \n\nTaking a more near-term look at Amazon\'s chart flashes similar warning signs, Newton said. From a weekly perspective, Amazon\'s RSI has hit 75 six times since 2015, and in five of those six instances the stock lost anywhere from 10-20 percent in the two-to-three-month period that followed.\n\nWhile "nobody disagrees with the longer-term" outlook for Amazon, a technical analysis suggests new investors may want to reconsider buying in at current levels, he said. If the RSI trends seen in the past repeat themselves, shares of Amazon could fall to $1,650, which implies a 17 percent drop and close to the 20-percent decline required to put the e-commerce stock in bear territory. \n\n"$1,650 is a level I want to buy it before $2,500," Newton said. "I think it goes down first."\n\n### Price Action\n\nAmazon shares hit $2,004.22 after the open Thursday and were trading down slightly at $1,997.54 at the time of publication.\n\n_Related Links:_\n\n_\'Margins To The Rescue\' After Amazon Misses Q2 Sales Estimates_\n\n_Morgan Stanley Lifts Amazon\'s Price Target To $2,500, Bullish On Waymo\'s Prospects For Alphabet_\n\n_Photo courtesy of Amazon.  _']
