Based on the provided market data and news, predict the LLM’s decision:
News Factors Considered:
['**Amazon.com, Inc.**(NASDAQ:AMZN)** ** has dropped plans for his New York City headquarters after local leaders raised objections to its plans, the company announced Thursday.\n\n"For Amazon, the commitment to build a new headquarters requires positive, collaborative relationships with state and local elected officials who will be supportive over the long-term," the company wrote in a blog post discussing the decision.\n\nWhile polls show that more than two-thirds of New Yorkers support the plan, politicians at the state and local level poisoned the relationship, the company suggested.\n\nThe move does not affect Amazon\'s plans to open new corporate campuses near Washington, D.C. or in Nashville, Tennessee.\n\nLearn more today\n\nAmazon had planned to create 25,000 jobs and occupy as much as eight million square feet of office space in its Long Island City headquarters, but had not yet purchased the land.\n\nGov. Andrew Cuomo, who secretly negotiated the deal for Amazon to come to New York in exchange for almost $3 billion in incentives, criticized opposition to the project, calling it "political malpractice."\n\nOpponents criticized the secret nature of negotiations, with bypassed normal procedures, as well as the size of the incentive package that drew Amazon to the Big Apple.\n\nDon\'t miss it. Register today.\n\nUnion interference also played a role in the opposition to the retail giant, and negotiations between union leaders and supporters of the deal clearly did not convince Amazon that moving forward was the correct move.\n\n"This is the same reason why you see manufacturers, including automakers, build plants in Alabama, Tennessee, Georgia, South Carolina and other right-to-work states," said Michael Crosby, a FreightWaves market expert in shipping. "Business leaders have many choices for where to locate their operations, and dealing with this level opposition to their plans can be easily overcome by going elsewhere."\n\nThe cost of doing business in New England in general, and New York in particular, along with union-related inflexibility and expense, has been cited in the bankruptcy and ongoing dissolution of New England Motor Freight, a large less-than-truckload carrier that announced this week that it would shut down.\n\nDon\'t miss these opportunities to improve your business.

The company said it would have created more than 25,000 new jobs in the city but faced opposition from local lawmakers over the proposed $3 billion in local and state wide incentives.\n\nAmazon said in a statement the decision to scrap plans is based on a lack of "positive, collaborative relationships with state and local elected officials who will be supportive over the long-term." Instead, the company faced local and state level politicians who "made it clear that they oppose our presence and will not work with us to build the type of relationships that are required to go forward with the project."\n\n_Realted Link:Not Win Nor Place, But Nashville A Show In Race For New Amazon Locations_\n\n### Why It\'s Important\n\nNew York City mayor Bill de Blasio and New York Governor Andrew Cuomo were credited with working tirelessly on behalf of the people of New York to encourage Amazon\'s efforts and desire to oversee job creations, the statement also read.\n\nAmazon does not intend to re-open its second headquarters at this time but will proceed as planned with new facilities in Northern Virginia and Nashville. The company will also continue to hire and grow across its 17 corporate offices and technology hubs in both the U.S. and Canada.\n\nAmazon shares were little changed Thursday afternoon.\n\n_Brooklyn Bridge, Spanning East River between Brooklyn & Manhattan, New York City. Photo courtesy of the Library on Congress._\n\nTruck stops have incorporated a number of side businesses to keep up with the changing needs of customers - gaming, branded restaurants, and crude-oil hauling to name a few.\n\nBut generating electricity hasn\'t even been on the radar.\n\nNow, as the prospects for electric trucks shift from concept to reality, Neil Chatterjee believes electricity generation could be the next big thing.\n\nAs Chairman of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission - the top regulator of the nation\'s power grid - Chatterjee said the need for a stable electricity infrastructure to support the trucking industry is analogous to a trend occurring among the world\'s technology platforms.\n\n"If you look at the big energy users - **Google**(NASDAQ:GOOGL), **Amazon.com, Inc.  **(NASDAQ:AMZN), **Facebook, Inc.  **(NASDAQ:FB) - they\'re moving beyond the traditional model where they\'re just energy consumers, they\'re actually impacting energy markets because their data centers consume so much power," said Chatterjee, speaking with FreightWaves on February 12 after a NATSO board meeting at the fuel retailer group\'s annual conference in Orlando.\n\nBecause they eat so much power, those ubiquitous tech companies have built their own wind- and solar-generated power stations. To meet the needs of an electric truck future, truck stops may eventually consider doing the same, Chatterjee said.\n\nDon\'t miss it. Register today.\n\n"If the trend lines continue, an electric truck is going to be a lot larger, more elaborate, and more expensive to recharge than a passenger vehicle. And if you\'re a Pilot Flying J operating in 44 states and absorbing massive energy costs as a result of the electric transition that could come, I think you would have to consider an alternative means, rather than just procuring power from your utility and having it taken from you."\n\nAs federal policy stands today, Chatterjee said, a driver in a battery-powered truck wouldn\'t care what the truck stop\'s electricity costs are - he would be able to get his truck recharged at no cost "other than what he was charged for chips and soda," because there is as yet no mechanism in place to compensate the truck stop owner.\n\nAnother question: if a truck stop owner decides to invest in electric generation, where would that owner locate the generating source?\n\n"There\'s a misconception of the need for a rooftop to install solar - it doesn\'t have to be within your square footage on site, you could have it built offsite and piped in. There would be many ways to go about this."\n\nExploring these questions was the point of opening a dialogue with fuel retailers regarding electric trucks, he said. "It\'s a very complicated issue. We will have to sort through what [compensation] would mean - it could include carve outs and deals with utilities, the possibility of a resale of electricity, or procuring your own generation. But it\'s all theoretical right now."\n\nA native of Lexington, Kentucky, Chatterjee was nominated to FERC by President Donald Trump and confirmed by the U.S. Senate in 2017. He\'s not a stranger to infrastructure - electric or otherwise. Prior to joining the commission, he was energy policy advisor to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) during the Obama administration, and over the years has helped shape major energy, highway, and agriculture legislation.\n\nLearn more today\n\nWhile he hadn\'t read the details of the Democrat\'s Green New Deal, which would have to rely heavily on electric vehicles to achieve its goal of zero emissions in the transportation sector within 10 years, he agrees with many who view it as overly ambitious.\n\nBut he has also seen first-hand how legislation considered to have little chance in Congress in its original form can nonetheless become the basis for things that eventually get done.\n\n"The point of [the Green New Deal] being rolled out now is to drive the political conversation in a certain direction, and [NATSO] has to pay attention. Just because the overall package goes nowhere doesn\'t mean you don\'t need to track it. Small pieces can gain traction, and you don\'t want to be blindsided by it."\n\nWant more content like this?

Some positive export data out of China didn\'t hurt, either. \n\nHowever, it looks like the weak markets and government shutdown situation in December might have taken a bite out of consumer spending, as retail sales fell 1.2% that month, the government said. Wall Street had expected a 0.2% rise, according to Briefing.com. Futures prices quickly turned tail after that report, and major indices came under pressure in pre-market trading. Concerns about the consumer might return based on this news.\n\nWhile the overall market seemed to have a positive reaction to news of a possible trade deadline extension, kicking the can down the road isn\'t necessarily a completely positive thing. It would mean more questions for corporations, which would be forced to continue making spending and other strategic decisions without knowing how the trade deal might ultimately play out. For companies, it\'s hard to play the game if you don\'t know the rules.\n\nWednesday marked the second straight day of the S&P 500 (SPX) closing above its 200-day moving average of 2743. Unlike Tuesday, when the SPX barely topped the average, it eclipsed that mark Wednesday with room to spare. Sometimes a few closes above key moving averages can help provide momentum, though certainly other factors can drive markets as well. We\'ll have to wait and see if the SPX can maintain this technical strength, something it failed to do back in early December when it last crossed the 200-day line.\n\nThe SPX also managed to finish above 2750, another level that some technical analysts had been watching. It was the first close above 2750 since Dec. 3, so the market is at nearly two-and-a-half month highs. It\'s really pretty remarkable how far things have come since the Christmas Eve lows down around 2350. The SPX is up more than 400 points since then, or 17%, but remains down 6% from the all-time high close of just over 2930 recorded last Sept. 19.\n\nAlso, all of the major U.S. indices have emerged from correction (which is down 10% or more from highs). If you recall, the SPX teetered on the edge of a bear market at the end of the day Dec. 24. Post-market trading that evening actually took it down more than 20% from its high, which is the definition of a bear market.\n\n### Border Bill, Shutdown Still Not Wrapped Up\n\nHopes for a trade deal with China and chances to avert a government shutdown both played a big role in the market\'s strength so far this week. However, the shutdown situation remains fluid, so investors might want to consider keeping a close eye on things as the week closes, especially with a three-day weekend ahead. The markets are closed next Monday for President\'s Day.\n\nIt\'s possible the weekend could arrive with investors uncertain about the status of the border bill in Congress. The president has until midnight Friday to sign, and that\'s hours after the market closes for three days. If there\'s a hitch in the process leading to a possible shutdown, it might be worth watching futures market action Monday night to get a sense of how things could go Tuesday morning. A volatility spike can\'t be ruled out if things don\'t get resolved in Washington.\n\nThe benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury yield climbed back above 2.7% for the first time in about a week Wednesday, possibly a sign of investors getting more positive about the economy. On a less positive note, the U.S. dollar index edged above 97 again, possibly a sign of investor concerns about economic growth overseas. The looming prospect of a no-deal Brexit could be one factor favoring the dollar, and a stronger dollar can often spell trouble for major U.S. multinational companies.\n\nThat said, the industrial, energy, and info tech sectors--where many U.S. multinationals live--didn\'t show much sign of impending economic concerns. Industrials and energy were among the leading sectors Wednesday, and financials also rose. Of all U.S. sectors, only utilities and communication services walked away in the red Wednesday.\n\nHowever, the FAANGS--which have often helped drive momentum for the overall market--finished mostly lower. Also, shares of **Boeing Co  **(NYSE:BA) and **Caterpillar Inc  **(NYSE:CAT) finished lower and just a touch higher, respectively. Both of these companies are often viewed as barometers for U.S./China relations, since they have big businesses in China. BA has been on a roll lately, but CAT shares have struggled since the company turned in earnings per share that fell short of third-party consensus estimates and guidance that disappointed some analysts late last month.\n\nVolatility remains near historic averages as the VIX flirts with the 15 mark. It hasn\'t fallen below that level since early October. \n\n### Fresh Batch of Earnings, Data\n\nThis morning saw some new data with the release of January producer prices and retail sales. Overall producer prices dropped 0.1% last month, but core prices (which strip out food and energy) rose 0.3%, above expectations. Consumer prices for January released Wednesday appeared pretty benign and didn\'t seem to spark much concern about inflation getting a foothold (see more below). \n\nChina\'s January exports rose 9.1%, a big turn-around from a decline of more than 4% in December. Still, its imports fell last month, so apparently not everything is well.\n\nCSCO earnings, released late Wednesday, beat analysts\' revenue and earnings per share expectations. Its guidance outpaced analyst projections, too, and the company said business in China is going well despite the trade battle. Shares were up 4% in pre-market trading Thursday.\n\nThings weren\'t looking quite as robust over at **The  ****Coca-Cola Co  **(NYSE:KO), which met Wall Street\'s earnings expectations and beat revenue estimates but appeared to disappoint some investors with its outlook. Shares fell 2% in pre-market trading.\n\nNvidia (NVDA) is due to report after the close today, and **Deere & Co **(NYSE:DE) and **PepsiCo, Inc.  **(NASDAQ:PEP) are tomorrow morning.\n\n### Unpack Your Bags\n\nA couple of travel sector names opened their earnings suitcases Wednesday, and the response was particularly good for **Hilton Hotels  **(NYSE:HLT). Shares rose nearly 7% Wednesday as HLT easily surpassed third-party consensus earnings per share projections and delivered a forecast that, while not judged spectacular by analysts, also was a bit better than many on Wall Street had expected.\n\nLike other companies this earnings season, HLT noted in its call that there\'s been a bit of a slowdown in some areas. While business travel continues to look strong, executives said, leisure is where things have slowed a bit, particularly in China. HLT\'s CEO said on the call that every economy has its ups and downs, and that while China might be down, HLT doesn\'t see that as long lasting. Judging from how the stock reacted, the Street seemed to like that statement.\n\nStill, when you look at HLT\'s hotels, they\'re catering to the middle- to upper-middle kind of customer, not the top of the food chain. So its struggles in China could mean the middle class in China is suffering more than we think.\n\nHLT also took some market share during the quarter, perhaps putting some pressure on competitors like **Hyatt Hotels Corporation** (NYSE:H), which reported later Wednesday, and **Marriott International Inc.  **(NASDAQ:MAR), which reports later this month. Market share seems to be the measure everyone is getting measured on, if you will, more than the expense of gaining market share. Also, hotels like HLT are finding every possible way to eke more revenue out of each room.\n\n**Figure 1: "TWO C\'s" OF RISK**: Copper futures (candlestick) and crude futures (purple line) are both up solidly since hitting recent lows in late December. Both of these commodities often see investor demand in times of economic growth amid ideas that demand could rise. Data Source: CME Group. Chart source: The thinkorswim® platform from TD Ameritrade. _For illustrative purposes only. Past performance does not guarantee future results._\n\n**Reining in the Horsemen** : When economic tides crash against the shore, we often talk about the so-called "horsemen" of risk, namely VIX (volatility), gold, the dollar, and U.S. Treasury bonds. These holdings all tend to see investor interest when there\'s a move toward "safe havens," though no investment can truly be called "safe." When the tides retreat a little, as they seemed to this week, many of the horsemen get reined in, and instead investors often gravitate toward areas that typically do better when economic conditions improve.\n\nAt this juncture, some of that seems evident, with sectors like energy and industrials leading the charge higher. Copper--often seen as an indicator of economic activity because it\'s used in so many industrial applications--has also bounced from December lows, and crude is up about 20% since diving under $50 a barrel late last year. Other areas that sometimes signal investor optimism also are enjoying nice runs, including U.S. small- and mid-cap stocks, along with transports. All of these are places investors might want to consider watching for further indication of market sentiment in coming weeks, but it\'s also noteworthy that the U.S. dollar continues to trade near recent highs, gold hasn\'t eased much, and Treasury yields remain quite low. These could be signs that at least some investors don\'t see hard times being truly over.\n\n**Eat Your Veggies** : If you feel like you\'ve been paying a bit more for restaurant meals, or if a new home purchase left your wallet light, it\'s probably not just your imagination. Yesterday\'s consumer price index (CPI) for January showed a 2.8% year-over-year jump in prices for food bought outside the home, and a 3.2% rise in shelter costs. Home heating costs also rose well above the overall 1.6% headline inflation increase since a year ago, the Labor Department said. Higher food costs in January weren\'t evenly spread, with beef among the biggest price gainers while fruit and vegetable prices fell. Even if you avoid restaurants and try to eat at home, you could get hit by higher food costs, depending on where you shop. Major media outlets reported this week that **Amazon.com, Inc.  **(NASDAQ:AMZN) has increased prices at its Whole Foods stores. Perhaps investors might want to tune in to **Walmart, Inc**  (NYSE:WMT) earnings call next week and also look at **Kroger Co  **(NYSE:KR) earnings early next month to get a better sense of where grocery prices might be going.\n\n**Looking Overseas** : A trade deal with China presumably would get a nice reaction from U.S. stocks, judging from the way things have gone lately just on rumors of possible progress. However, some analysts say any trade deal might benefit international stock markets more than those in the U.S., in part because of China\'s vast demand for goods that\'s been clipped a bit by the trade war, and because U.S. stocks might already have built in a good portion of the optimism around a possible resolution. \n\nAssuming Chinese demand for goods like food, automobiles, and energy tick up, that would have a chance to help many European companies. Some of the biggest beneficiaries might be those that make automobiles and chemicals, or supply raw materials or other manufactured goods. These were among the products China imported most from Europe in recent years, according to the European Commission. Canada, too, might benefit, as it exports billions of dollars worth of commodity and natural resource products to China, according to Stats Canada. So far this year, European stocks are up about 8%, while Canada\'s main stock index is up 9%. By comparison, the S&P 500 Index (SPX) is up nearly 10% year to date, while the Nasdaq (COMP) is up almost 12%.\n\n_Information from TDA is not intended to be investment advice or construed as a recommendation or endorsement of any particular investment or investment strategy, and is for illustrative purposes only.

 'The fourth-quarter results posted yesterday by **XPO Logistics, Inc.** (NYSE:XPO) reveal as much about Amazon.com, Inc.\'s logistics intentions as they do about XPO\'s outlook.\n\nXPO\'s "largest customer," which the company won\'t identify but which everyone believes to be **Amazon.com, Inc.**(NASDAQ:AMZN), is taking in-house most, if not all, of its $600 million of annual spend with XPO. That amounts to two-thirds of the customer\'s total spend with XPO. The first tranche, which disappeared last quarter, was so-called postal injection, where XPO moves goods from fulfillment centers to local post offices for deliveries to residences. The move happened suddenly and near the end of peak season. XPO knew the business would eventually depart, but it didn\'t know when. Yet it had to allocate assets as if it was business as usual.\n\nThe inability to quickly replace such a large amount of business blew a huge hole in the company\'s last-mile results. As a result, XPO reported that its key earnings metric - EBITDA - fell short in the fourth quarter, and that quarterly operating income in its transportation and logistics divisions declined year-over-year. In the case of transportation, the year-over-year drop was a substantial $25 million.\n\nThe company also lowered its guidance on 2019 results, saying revenue would grow 3 to 5 percent, EBITDA would rise by 6 to 10 percent, and free cash flow (FCF) would fall between $525 million and $625 million, down from the $650 million previously forecast. The FCF decline is due to a $275 million interest expense on $1 billion in debt that will be used to repurchase up to $1.5 billion in shares, which the company believes is quite undervalued at current levels.-\n\nFor XPO, the hit from the customer defection will linger well into 2019. The business that didn\'t go away last quarter will mostly depart in the first half. The "postal injection" segment that was the subject of XPO\'s fourth quarter angst will account for $200 million of lost revenue, Brad Jacobs, XPO\'s chairman and CEO, (pictured above) told analysts today. The other $400 million will come out of brokerage, intermodal and contract logistics, Jacobs said. The $300 million that\'s left is locked up in three-year contracts, though Jacobs said he was unsure if all of that would remain intact.\n\nIf the customer is indeed Seattle-based Amazon, it is another example of the company wanting to capture as much volume within its in-house network as is feasible. It also highlights the risk to shipping partners, even those with long-standing relationships with Amazon, if the e-tailer feels confident it can gain control of its traffic and do it more cost-effectively than its vendors. The consensus is that Amazon\'s volumes are so vast and growing so rapidly that it will be impossible for it to consistently hit delivery commitments without outside help. The consensus has been known to be wrong, however.\n\nAmazon, as it often tends to do, has sent mixed signals. On its fourth-quarter analyst call, executives said the company values its delivery partners. Yet in a recent Securities and Exchange Commission filing, it referred to some of those same partners as competitors.\n\nIf today\'s equity market moves are any indication, investors and traders believe that Amazon is indeed the XPO customer, and that its move has broader implications beyond XPO. Unsurprisingly, XPO shares traded sharply lower because of the company\'s disappointing results (though it closed off its worst levels). Yet shares of **FedEx Corp.**(NYSE:FDX) and **UPS, Inc.** , (NYSE:UPS) both of which haul for Amazon and on the surface should not be severely affected by company-specific news involving another provider, were also down. The much-sharper sell-off in FedEx shares may have also been prompted by the unexpected news that its president and COO, David J. Bronczek, would retire at the end of the month, and also retire from his seat on FedEx\'s board.\n\nDon\'t miss it. Register today.\n\nFor their part, XPO executives tried to put the best face on the fourth quarter actions of their "largest customer." The fulfillment center-to-post office segment has low barriers to entry and exhibits little value-added differentiation, they said. By contrast, the "over-the-threshold" delivery of heavy goods, a business that XPO dominates and which involves delivery, installation and take-away, is high-margin and value-added, they said. Jacobs, for his part, said the company expects to replace the lost business during the second half of the year as more volume from the 118 new contract logistics accounts signed up last year come on-stream.\n\nStill, Jacobs was forced to do today what he has done little of in XPO\'s mostly-charmed seven-year life - publicly admit problems and mistakes. "It hurts," he said when describing the impact of the lost business. The Greenwich, Connecticut-based company, which has dazzled analysts and investors with its business model and the rapid growth supporting it, now faces hard questions from the same people who have been in its corner and are now starting to doubt its story. Noting that XPO fell short of expectations for the second straight quarter - third-quarter results were revised down after the bankruptcy of U.K. retailer House of Fraser, a large XPO logistics customer,--Jacobs acknowledged that "we\'ve slipped on (the) banana peel twice." Analyst skepticism about the company\'s recent performance is "understandable," he said, adding that missing projections and lowering guidance after such a stellar multi-year run is "not our track record and it\'s not who we are."\n\nXPO has been guiding down expectations for some time, due in large part to weakness in two key European markets - the United Kingdom and France. Uncertainty over Britain\'s scheduled end-of-March exit from the European Union (EU) has curbed business. Meanwhile, the ongoing protests in France over proposed budget cuts by President Emmanuel Macron have turned sentiment upside down compared with a gung-ho outlook during 2017, Jacobs said. A "hard" Brexit, meaning the country would leave the EU with a clean break, would be very negative for the British economy and, by extension, XPO, Jacobs said. The situation in France isn\'t likely to change, so sentiment there will remain muted, he added.\n\nAnalysts, by and large, seem willing to give XPO the benefit of the doubt. But their patience is wearing thin. Perhaps the most telling reaction came from Amit Mehrotra, Deutsche Bank\'s lead transport analyst. Mehrotra has been one of XPO\'s staunchest bulls, going so far as to write a near point-by-point rebuttal in mid-December to a short-selling firm\'s scathing report on XPO that sent the equity plunging more than $15 a share in one day. In a note published this morning that started "not as bad as it looks (even though it looks really bad)," Mehrotra said he doesn\'t think "the fundamental story has changed." Revenue and cash flow prospects still look promising despite the loss of the customer, Mehrotra said. He added, however, that yesterday\'s results put XPO "deeper into the penalty box."\n\nWant more content like this?

Should we mourn the thousands of jobs that will go by the boards? Or should we applaud NYC for not succumbing to what the Daily Beast called "extortion without the dick pics?" The best way to understand the outcome is not through the post-mortems, but through the stories published in November when Amazon was making its decision. At the time, The Atlantic\'s Derek Thompson went out with an insightful piece entitled Amazon\'s "HQ2 Spectacle Should Be Illegal." Every year, American cities and states cough up $90 billion in tax breaks and cash grants to urge companies to move among states, Thompson wrote, citing data from think-tank Brookings. That\'s more than the federal government spends on housing, education, or infrastructure. Since cities and states can\'t print money or run deficits, these deals take scarce resources from schools, roads, police, and prisons, Thompson said. What\'s more, these incentives have no discernible impact on a firm\'s ability to expand, at least as measured by job creation. In addition, companies (think Foxconn in Wisconsin) can\'t be counted on to keep their promises. Finally, even if jobs are created and companies hold up their end of the bargains, it seems ludicrous for Americans to pay tens of billions of dollars for corporations to relocate within the U.S., Thompson wrote.__ Nothing illuminated this "absurdity," he said, more than the so-called Border War in which Kansas and Missouri spend "zillions of dollars" dragging Kansas City-area companies back and forth across state lines but all within the same metro area.\n\n## Did You Know?\n\n238 cities and municipalities submitted bids for Amazon "HQ2".\n\n## Quotable:\n\n"I\'m optimistic we will get that business back from other customers."\n\nXPO Logistics, Inc.

But a bullish macro outlook means little if you are unionized, operating in a high-cost region--the Northeast--against non-union competition, saddled with an aging fleet, and owned by an octogenarian who may not have wanted to do this anymore. A company\'s success or failure is often unrelated to the broader landscape surrounding it.\n\nHammer down everyone!\n\nWant more content like this? Click here to Subscribe\n\nPermalink'
 'Retail giant **Walmart Inc** (NYSE:WMT) reported Tuesday morning with fourth-quarter results that were better-than-expected and helped lift the stock higher by more than 3 percent.\n\n### Moody\'s O\'Shea: CEO Deserves Credit\n\nWalmart CEO Doug McMillon has done a "terrific job" in managing the company under the philosophy that if the company invests in the business, clients will come, Moody\'s lead Walmart analyst Charles O\'Shea said as a guest on CNBC\'s "Squawk Box" segment.\n\nThis is most evident in Walmart\'s U.S. net sales, which rose by a "massive" 4.6 percent in the Q4, while the 40-percent growth in e-commerce sales suggests it will soon become a $20-billion-a-year unit.\n\n"These are big numbers -- 2-percent growth is $10 billion," he said. "That\'s the thing people may forget over time is how big that company really is."\n\n### Strategic Resource Group\'s Flickinger: Amazon\'s \'Worst Nightmares\'\n\nBurt Flickinger, managing director of Strategic Resource Group, told CNBC ahead of Walmart\'s report that the Bentonville, Arkansas-based retailer is poised to become "one of **Amazon.com, Inc.** (NASDAQ:AMZN)\'s worst nightmares."\n\nThe company has been able to "attract the best and the brightest" to its team, including Jet.com founder Marc Lore, who now leads Walmart\'s e-commerce business.\n\nChecks and conversations with vendors and customers point to Walmart\'s e-commerce business gaining momentum at a time when Amazon\'s business is "going sideways," Flickinger said. \n\n### Gordon Haskett\'s Grom: 3 Takeaways\n\nChuck Grom, senior retail analyst at Gordon Haskett, named three takeaways from the Q4 print during a guest spot on "Bloomberg Daybreak: Americas." \n\n  * The reported 4.2-percent same-store sales growth in the U.S. business includes a benefit from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. Excluding SNAP from the results implies comps would have been up 3.8 percent otherwise, Grom said. \n  * Walmart\'s margins were not only strong, but came in better-than-expected across each operating segment.\n  * E-commerce growth remains "healthy" and contributed around two points to overall comps.\n\n\n\nWalmart continues to "execute very well" overall, the analyst said.\n\nGrom said he will revisit his firm\'s neutral stance on Walmart, adding that a bullish rating can now be justified at over 20 times earnings. Other retail names stand to outperform Walmart, especially dollar store chains, he said. \n\n_Related Links:_\n\n_Walmart Brings Bright Spot To Market Otherwise Cautious As Trade Talks Continue_\n\n_What Traders Need To Know About The US Consumer In 2019_\n\n_Photo by MikeMozartJeepersMedia/Wikimedia.  _'
 'It seems odd that arguably the world\'s most powerful company would get bent out of shape over one executive\'s departure. But Kenneth Wagers was not just any executive, and he didn\'t go to just any company.\n\nAt **Amazon.com, Inc.** (NASDAQ:AMZN), Wagers, known to nearly everyone as "Kenny," ran a far-reaching portfolio. As head of the company\'s global transportation business, Wagers headed up last-mile, middle-mile, Amazon China, air and ocean operations, the "Amazon Fresh" grocery delivery business, and the "Prime Now" same-day operation. Given Amazon\'s profound transition from simple e-tailing to a complex model emphasizing transportation and logistics, it would be hard to imagine an executive, other than Founder, Chairman and CEO Jeff Bezos, whose loss would be more costly.\n\nTo complicate matters, Wagers was wooed from Amazon by transport and logistics giant **XPO Logistics, Inc**. (NYSE:XPO), which he joined last April as its chief operating officer, adding the title of interim head of its less-than-truckload unit in June. XPO had created a service called "XPO Direct," which integrates contract logistics, middle and last-mile transportation into an end-to-end network aimed at businesses that don\'t want to manage the process themselves. The service resembles Amazon\'s "Fulfillment by Amazon" (FBA) operation, where the company provides merchants with an online storefront, warehousing, fulfillment, distribution and delivery. FBA accounts for more than half of Amazon\'s sales.\n\nAs it happens, Amazon is a user of XPO Direct, presumably for heavier consignments, which is XPO\'s sole business.\n\nExecutives move between companies all the time. Wagers didn\'t sign a non-compete contract with Amazon, so he was free to go elsewhere. Thus, his decision might not have sparked any further discussion. Then last Thursday, XPO disclosed that its largest customer - which it wouldn\'t identify but whom everyone knew to be Amazon - would pull $600 million in traffic, or two-thirds of Amazon\'s total annual spend with XPO. The first segment, valued at $200 million, was withdrawn in late December and impacted XPO\'s postal injection business (it transports goods from distribution or fulfillment centers to postal locations for final delivery). The other $400 million will disappear during the first half of 2019, and will be spread across multiple transportation functions. The remaining $300 million of business that Amazon has with XPO is tied up in long-term contracts, and will stay put for now.\n\nDon\'t miss it. Register today.\n\nThe loss of the postal injection business caused XPO to report fourth-quarter results that were below its original forecasts. The loss of the remaining business forced the company to lower its outlook for 2019. Traders and investors responded the following day by heavily marking down XPO\'s share price. The shares have recovered some of that ground since then.\n\nThere are a number of plausible explanations for Amazon\'s move, including it is investing heavily in its own supply chain, and may have decided it was more cost-effective to take much, if not all, of the XPO business in-house. Or it may not have been happy with XPO\'s performance. Or it may have decided that with the hiring of Wagers and the development of a competing service, tendering so much business to XPO didn\'t make a lot of sense. Amit Mehrotra, an analyst for Deutsche Bank, published a research note yesterday in which he said the last scenario was the most credible. Mehrotra said XPO should take heart in Amazon\'s decision because it signals that XPO Direct is gaining traction in the marketplace.\n\nThen there is the more dramatic explanation - that Amazon was so peeved by Wagers jumping to XPO that it took away the business out of spite. An industry source advanced such a theory. Last year Amazon asked XPO to "reconsider" its decision to hire Wagers, effectively requesting that it fire the executive, the source said. XPO denied Amazon\'s request, according to an industry source.  It is unclear how the two sides left it, other than the fact that Wagers remains employed at XPO.\n\n"This is retribution. This is payback," the source said in describing Amazon\'s decision to pull the business. Asked if some type of compromise could have been achieved, the source said that "Amazon doesn\'t compromise." The development of the XPO Direct service was a secondary factor in Amazon\'s decision, the source said. XPO declined comment on the matter. Amazon called the source\'s comments "untrue and ridiculous."\n\nAmazon\'s competitive concerns surrounding XPO Direct are misplaced because XPO doesn\'t function as an e-tailer like Amazon, the source said. What\'s more, Amazon, though it is expanding its delivery footprint to include heavy commodities like furniture, still handles mostly small-parcel shipments. This puts the bulk of Amazon\'s traffic outside of XPO\'s wheelhouse.\n\nLearn more today\n\nXPO Direct is the culmination of Chairman and CEO Brad Jacobs\' vision of the ideal mechanism to capture the relentless surge in e-commerce traffic, and in particular heavy goods movement. Indeed, no provider may be better positioned to handle the continued double-digit growth of non-parcel orders placed online. The Greenwich, Connecticut-based company has assembled a heavy freight network combining more than 90 contract logistics facilities, the second-largest LTL operation and what is considered the strongest last-mile delivery business for heavy goods in the country.\n\nIn an effort to repair the damage to a share price that has been cut by more than half since last September, XPO has bought back $1 billion of its common shares, and it plans to buy back another $1.5 billion over an undetermined time period. Jacobs told _FreightWaves_ on February 14 that XPO is shelving plans to acquire other companies in lieu of the share buybacks, which he said is a far more effective use of its capital.\n\nJacobs had told investors in late 2017 that the company would make one, and perhaps two acquisitions during 2018. None were made, however, though Jacobs said XPO was close to a deal before a mid-December short-seller\'s report sent shares plummeting and made the buyback option more attractive. XPO acquired and integrated 17 companies from 2011 to 2015, an unprecedented run in the history of the industry. Its last acquisition was the $3 billion purchase of truckload and logistics giant Con-way Inc. in September 2015.\n\nWant more content like this?

This will ultimately allow the company to support deliveries in the Bay Area, central California, Sacramento, Orange County and Los Angeles areas.  \n\nOn Tuesday, the company named Jerrin James as  its chief operating officer. James was previously the head of logistics at **Facebook, Inc.** (NASDAQ:FB) and has worked at **Amazon.com, Inc.** (NASDAQ:AMZN) and **Groupon Inc** (NASDAQ:GRPN). \n\nInterested in learning more about the growing company, Benzinga reached out to Driven Deliveries CEO **Chris Boudreau  **and asked him a few questions.\n\n"This is an exciting time for our company, as we continue to grow at an exponential rate," he told Benzinga.\n\n"As we plan to advance through California and to surrounding states, Driven Deliveries will maintain the highest service to our customer while adding numerous partnerships along the way. We will continue to increase our value to our shareholders, partners and customers."\n\n### Meet Driven Deliveries\n\nBenzinga asked how Driven Deliveries differentiates from other delivery services and how it competes with established names like Eaze.\n\nThe company provides a "turnkey, white-labeled delivery solution for retailers where others are either their own retailer, or are acting as though they are a licensed retailer -- like Eaze," Boudreau said.\n\nIn his view, Driven Deliveries is not a head-to-head competitor to those other companies; instead, Boudreau likes to think of his company as a **GrubHub Inc**(NYSE:GRUB) or Uber Eats for the cannabis industry, providing vehicles, drivers and management and consulting services.\n\nDriven Deliveries is exploring doing business in 10 states and intends to move into three or four of them by the end of 2019, the CEO said.  \n\n### Financials\n\nNext up, we got into the company\'s public listing.\n\nIt was Driven Deliveries\' investors who suggested the company go public at first, Boudreau said.\n\n"But with the excitement around cannabis businesses in the public markets, it made sense as a strategic play -- and it\'s definitely working out for us."\n\nThe San Diego-based company recently hit a $150-million market cap and is just getting started, the CEO said. \n\nDriven Deliveries also changed its ticker recently and underwent a stock split. \n\nThe ticker change related to getting rid of the symbol used by the company\'s prior shell, Boudreau said. The 12.35-to-1 stock split was done to "create more shares in the float," he said. \n\n### Just For Fun\n\nFinally, Benzinga asked a few questions just out of curiosity.\n\nOur first: what are the most popular products that consumers order for delivery? \n\nThat would be flower and vape pens, Boudreau said. "We expect to see increasing demand for vape pens and edibles, and decreasing demand for flower." \n\nLastly, we asked about the difference between delivering cannabis and other goods, like pizza.\n\n"Functionally, the delivery itself isn\'t very different than for a pizza company, just with a lot more technology," the CEO said.\n\nThe technology includes forward- and rear-facing cameras in the car, GPS trackers and a locking safe box for secured transportation and storage.\n\n"They\'re probably not doing that for pizza and lasagna."\n\n_Related Links:_\n\n_Former Yahoo, Autodesk CEO Carol Bartz Talks Cannabis Space, Caliva Investment:\'It Was Just Obvious\' _\n\n_Scoop: One Of America\'s Top Pharmaceutical Drug Directories Includes CBD Products For The First Time Ever _\n\nAir cargo carrier **Atlas Air Worldwide Holdings, Inc.** (NASDAQ:AAWW) today posted solid fourth quarter and full-year results, and issued a bullish outlook for 2019.\n\nThe Purchase, N.Y.-based company, which generates most of its revenue by flying freighter aircraft for airlines, the military, and other customers, posted record revenue of $765 million, a 22-percent increase from the year-earlier period. On an adjusted basis, income from continuing operations, net of taxes, rose 31 percent to $87 million from adjusted income of $66 million. Adjusted EBITDA rose 21 percent to $196.5 million.\n\nAircraft "block" hours, the industry-standard measure for aircraft utilization, rose 19 percent during the period for the company\'s core "ACMI" service, Atlas said. This was due to start-up flying for Boeing 747-400s for several new customers and increased peak-season flying for Amazon.com, Inc., which has leased 20 of B767-300 cargo planes from Atlas. Revenue per block hour in the quarter was about the same as in the 2017 quarter, Atlas said.\n\nUnder a contractual ACMI relationship, Atlas supplies the aircraft, crew, maintenance, and insurance. The customer typically provides the fuel and other services. ACMI services differ from charter operations--which Atlas is also involved in--that are shorter-term in nature, often don\'t involve contracts, and call for the operator to provide all the flying services.\n\nFor the year, revenue rose 24 percent to a record $2.7 billion, while block hours increased 17 percent over 2017 totals to more than 296,264 hours, Atlas said. Income from continuing operations, net of taxes, rose 21 percent over 2017 totals. Both years included significant gains resulting from one-time circumstances, Atlas said. Adjusted EBITDA rose 26 percent to $540.6 million, Atlas said\n\nAtlas added 16 aircraft to its fleet last year, bringing its fleet size at year-end to 112. Last year marked the first time in history Atlas had more than 100 planes in its fleet.\n\nDon\'t miss it. Register today.\n\nThe company expects 2019 block hours to rise to 340,000 hours as it generates a full-year\'s worth of flying out of the planes it added last year. About three-quarters of those hours will come from ACMI service, it said Full-year revenue should exceed $3 billion, and adjusted EBITDA should come in around $600 million. Air tonnage should continue to grow this year as global economic activity expands at a moderate clip.\n\nWilliam J. Flynn, Atlas\' president and CEO, said the company should not have any trouble obtaining "feedstock," industry lingo for passenger aircraft eligible to be converted into freighter aircraft. He declined to comment on whether **Amazon.com, Inc**. (NASDAQ:AMZN), which added 10 aircraft to a similar 20-plane deal with Atlas\' rival **Air Transport Services Group**  (NASDAQ:ATSG), will pursue a similar expansion with Atlas. "We see good growth potential" across the company and its customers, Flynn said.\n\nBusiness between Asia and Europe was slower coming out of the Lunar New Year than was trans-Pacific volumes between Asia and the U.S., he added\n\nJesse Cohen, a long-time airline executive and now FreightWavers\' air cargo market expert, said Atlas has "done a nice job expanding out of its prior niche" of flying 747 freighters with the Amazon deal, and with 2018 being a great year for air freight, it benefited from that." Atlas is unparalleled in the niche it serves, said Cohen. "I don\'t see anyone else out there with their depth," he said.\n\nFlynn said he wasn\'t concerned about the impact of higher U.S. tariffs on Chinese imports on Atlas\' business. Because its business is aircraft, "we can move the business anywhere," he said. As a result, if China no longer becomes a viable production source, Atlas planes can be repositioned elsewhere in the region, he said.\n\nThe Trump administration has said it would hike tariffs on $200 billion of Chinese goods to 25 percent from 10 percent if a trade deal isn\'t agreed to by March 2 or if the current arrangement isn\'t extended pending any progress on negotiations.\n\nWant more content like this?

But investors seem to not think so when it comes to the ongoing trade negotiations between the United States and China. \n\nParticipants in equities markets around the globe appear to be focused on progress between the world\'s two largest economies in resolving the trade war before a March 1 deadline.\n\nAfter U.S. equities gained ground on Tuesday, Asian and European shares were mostly higher after President Trump seemed to suggest he might consider moving back that deadline. He said it wasn\'t a "magical date."\n\nInvestors were probably cheered by that sentiment given that if the U.S. and China don\'t reach a deal by March 1, U.S. tariffs on $200 billion in Chinese imports are scheduled to rise from 10% to 25%. \n\nStill, it seems that negotiators, who were in Beijing last week and who are continuing talks this week, want to get a deal done before then. That\'s the assumption the market has been making as it has rallied on that optimism.\n\nThe trade war between the U.S. and China has affected billions of dollars in goods and sparked concerns about corporate and economic growth around the globe. \n\n### Airlines Stocks in Descent\n\nOne place where concerns about global growth have been reflected is in oil prices, amid worries about global demand taking a hit. But black gold has been rallying for several days, amid the production cut agreed to by OPEC and other major exporters, as well as U.S. sanctions on Iran and Venezuela. That rally is under pressure this morning, however, after the U.S. Energy Information Administration said that U.S. shale production will rise to a record of about 8.4 million barrels a day in March.\n\nIn news from the airline industry, which is heavily exposed to the price of crude, this morning **Southwest Airlines Co** (NYSE:LUV) shares were down more than 4% after it said the 35-day partial government shutdown affected sales more than it expected. The discount airline is now expecting to lose $60 million in revenue in Q1 as a result of the closure, which it said caused softness in bookings.\n\nMeanwhile, LUV also took a hit from a downgrade to a sell rating from Goldman Sachs, which warned that LUV\'s new Hawaii route may be too costly. And further compounding LUV\'s woes was its grappling with a number of grounded planes on Tuesday as 180 aircraft were taken out of service for maintenance, about twice its normal number.\n\nOne question is whether we\'ll see additional shutdown-related pain in other airlines and a trickle-down effect in hotels and rental cars. So far, several other carriers have already warned that the shutdown will have a negative impact on their sales, including **United Continental Holdings** (NASDAQ:UAL), **Delta Air Lines, Inc.** (NYSE:DAL) and **American Airlines Group Inc** (NASDAQ:AAL), all of which were down about 1% in pre-market trade.\n\n### Fed in Focus\n\nWhile that headwind continues, the market has seen considerable relief this year on expectations that the Federal Reserve has hit the brakes on interest rate hikes for the time being. \n\nNew York Fed President John Williams in an interview with Reuters published Tuesday reiterated that dovish stance, saying he didn\'t think U.S. interest rates would need to be raised unless the economy or inflation unexpectedly shifted higher. \n\nInvestors are scheduled to get another glimpse into the Fed\'s thinking later today with the release of the minutes from the central bank\'s last meeting. At that meeting, the Fed stood pat on interest rates amid a more dovish stance on monetary policy that comes as it says inflationary pressures have been muted. \n\nIn addition to looking for more clarity on the Fed\'s outlook for inflation and monetary policy, investors may also be trying to discern more about the central bank\'s thoughts on reducing the bonds it holds on its balance sheet.\n\nThe Fed\'s bond buying program was designed to stabilize the market during the financial crisis, and an orderly unwinding of those positions points to increased faith in the strength of the economy. But questions remain on the timeline of the selloff and how much the Fed unwinds.\n\n### Bright Spots in Retail, Housing\n\nIn corporate news that also helped the market Tuesday, **Walmart Inc  **(NYSE:WMT) reported better-than-expected earnings, a welcome counterpoint for bulls who had been disappointed in recent weak government retail sales data for December. The retailing giant\'s results were helped by e-commerce sales growth of more than 40%. (See more on Walmart below.)\n\nWith consumer spending making up the single largest contribution to U.S. gross domestic product, any bullish news on that front can help move the market higher. Recent consumer confidence numbers weren\'t so hot, declining more than expected. Recent consumer credit data has also appeared to continue to paint a picture of an American consumer that, while seemingly not down and out, hasn\'t been showing as much strength as retailers might want.\n\nYesterday, the latest National Association of Home Builders/Wells Fargo Housing Market Index showed that builder confidence in the market for newly-built single-family homes rose to 62 in February as mortgage rates that have been falling in recent weeks combined with job market strength to held builder sentiment. The figure was ahead of a Briefing.com consensus expectation of 59.\n\nOther housing market data, out this morning from the Mortgage Bankers Association, showed that the group\'s mortgage applications index rose 3.6% last week from the prior week.\n\nThe two reports provide some good news for the housing market, which has been a thorn in the side of the U.S. economy amid affordability issues.\n\n**Figure 1: That Golden Sheen:**  The stock market has calmed down considerably since the selloff late last year, yet gold (candlestick chart) is at its highest point since April. Since the yellow metal is often considered a haven in times of market distress, what gives? Well, gold is also sensitive to the dollar, often moving in the opposite direction to the greenback (dollar index shown as purple line). So as the buck has weakened a bit recently, that has helped gold move higher even as stocks also move up.

Past performance does not guarantee future results_.  \n\n**Checking Out Online** : Walmart\'s shares closed more than 2.2% higher yesterday after the retailing giant reported better-than-expected earnings. Its profit was driven in part by more-than-40% growth in e-commerce sales. In the general retail industry, as brick-and-mortar sales give way to online clicks, it\'s perhaps no surprise, at least in the big scheme of things, that online sales are helping Walmart. But what may be surprising is that, according to a Yahoo Finance article, WMT\'s gargantuan footprint of physical stores throughout the United States is an advantage when competing against **Amazon.com, Inc.  **(NASDAQ:AMZN), which has been ramping up its home-delivery of groceries through its Prime membership and Whole Foods ownership. "As the online e-commerce giant makes its foray into the grocery business, it has to build more physically (sic) locations to support the supply chain," the article said. "This is where Walmart has an inherent advantage, with its more than 4,700 stores in the U.S. and 90% of Americans living within 10 miles of a store."\n\n**Global Payouts** : Growth in dividends paid out by companies around the globe is expected to slow this year after bumper payouts in 2018 despite a rocky finish to the market\'s year, says **Janus Henderson Group** (NYSE:JHG). Global distributions rose 9.3% to hit a record $1.37 trillion last year, with thirteen countries delivering record payouts, including the United States, according to the latest Janus Henderson Global Dividend Index. This year, the asset manager expects payouts to rise more modestly at 3.3% to $1.414 trillion, more than double what companies distributed ten years ago. That forecast may be reassuring to some investors as company outlooks for the year have been tending toward the dismal and worries about global economic growth have ratcheted up. "It is important for investors to distinguish between slower growth in payouts and dividend cuts," according to Ben Lofthouse, head of global equity income with Janus Henderson Investors. "Even when market volatility reflects investor angst, dividends tend to follow a steadier trajectory."\n\n**Small Caps in Focus** : Could 2019 be the year of the small cap? One thing U.S. small cap stocks have going for them is that they\'re typically not as exposed to the reverberations of the U.S.-China trade dispute like large multinational companies are. And there are other advantages that small caps have, at least as measured by the S&P SmallCap 600 Index, says investment research firm CFRA. According to Capital IQ consensus estimates, 2019 earnings per share growth for SPX companies is expected at just 3.1% compared with EPS growth expectations of 10% for the S&P SmallCap 600 Index. "Small caps have come back into investor favor, and based on relative price performance, EPS growth projections and discounted relative P/E (price-to-earnings ratio), we think they will outperform their larger-cap siblings in 2019," CFRA said.'

The views expressed here are those of Maron and do not necessarily reflect the opinions of FreightWaves._\n\nHurricane Katrina was a catastrophe of unprecedented proportions during the record-breaking 2005 Atlantic hurricane season, but it also served as an early example of how useful crowd-sourcing and satellite imagery can be in disaster response.\n\nWhat were then fortuitous lightning-bulb moments in using data-driven images and analytics in emergency situations are now considered landmark moments in terms of how individuals, enterprises, government institutions and relief organizations can dramatically hasten reaction times in life- and property-threatening situations.\n\nIn fact, the world's top retailer established an early standard for the logistics industry in how to use mapping, predictive modeling and data processing to deliver supplies to victims in the storm's aftermath. No less than the Wall Street Journal praised **Walmart Inc**  (NYSE:WMT) in the wake of the disaster, and the Weatherhead School of Management at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland detailed the chain's critical activities in a case study, including these points:\n\nLearn more today\n\n●     Used point-of-purchase data culled from other hurricanes to determine what supplies its victims would need.\n\n●     Monitored weather reports to redirect goods originally planned to be shipped to Florida to the Mississippi/Louisiana Gulf Coast when the storm's course shifted.\n\n●     Consistently reached relief workers and citizens in need faster than FEMA.\n\n## **Setting new standards**\n\nWalmart was not alone in leveraging nascent technologies during Katrina. Crowdsourcing efforts analyzed satellite map images to track storm damage, with many of the images coming from the Remote Sensing Division of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). The standard NOAA and other organizations helped set highlighted the importance of having historic and post-event data at hand for analysis, flexible operations based on that data for everyday activities and strong connections to impacted communities and relief workers.\n\nA decade and a half later, climate change has dramatically increased the ferocity, pace and volume of natural disasters such as storms, floods and fires - creating greater strain on logistics-based relief efforts. Fortunately, mapping technologies, predictive data analytics and communications capabilities have evolved at a relatively similar pace. Entrenched GPS navigation software apps are already helping people maneuver around crowded thoroughfares.\n\n## **Proactive efforts**\n\nToday, the transportation and logistics (T&L) industry finds itself in a pivotal position to play a substantial role in aiding crisis efforts - and mitigating the effects on communities and their citizens - more than ever before.\n\nSpecifically, T&L enterprises - in conjunction with government agencies, non-governmental organizations and volunteer organizations - are now at the forefront of creating virtual collaborative communities that can better assist relief efforts during natural disasters by:\n\n●     Shipping supplies to precisely targeted areas before an event occurs.\n\n●     Ensuring the goods are distributed in a timely matter to citizens and relief organizations during a crisis.\n\n●     Helping recovery efforts after disaster strikes.\n\n## **Preparation matters**\n\nTo be sure, it's impossible to predict some natural events such as earthquakes and wildfires, frustrating urgent relief efforts and timely distribution of warehoused critical supplies. Northern California retailers, for example, quickly ran out of air purifiers and breathing masks within two days of the mid-November 2018 Camp Fire that wiped out the town of Paradise, and rendered the usually fresh San Francisco Bay area air practically unbreathable for more than a week.\n\nBut mapping, location and communications tools can be extremely helpful in logistical efforts to mitigate delays and promote quicker disaster response. That's especially true if these efforts are coordinated among different sectors and groups - such as governments, universities, nonprofits, etc. - in an open and public way.\n\n Cloud-based mapping is already the go-to tool to assist first responders and citizens during disasters. As one of many examples, both Houston and Miami embraced the power of data-driven solutions and mapping to mitigate the threats against public health and safety in hurricanes Harvey and Irma. Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) mapping was also deployed in these and other disasters, not only to process images of damaged areas but also to facilitate faster claims processes for insurance purposes.\n\nDownload it today\n\n## Open communication\n\nMeanwhile, teams from NASA and Development Seed have developed Cumulus, a cloud-based platform that leverages open observation data and artificial intelligence (AI) to estimate a storm's destructive potential six times faster than traditional processes - a huge help in preparing and planning for relief and rescue efforts.\n\nThe Open Data for Resilience Initiative (OpenDRI) is a World Bank initiative that has established prototypes for the type of collaborative, data-driven disaster risk management initiatives we're advocating. In addition to creating a checklist of 10 guiding principles for the effective use of risk data, the World Bank is leveraging the global open data movement to manage disaster risk, including:\n\n●     Mapping flood vulnerability in Niger.\n\n●     Partnering with the United Nations, the Red Cross, **Google**(NASDAQ:GOOG), **Amazon.com, Inc.**(NASDAQ:AMZN)** ** and **Microsoft Corporation**(NASDAQ:MSFT)** ** to use data about floods, droughts and migrations to prevent famine across the globe and mitigate its effects.\n\n●     Using information and communication technologies (ICTs) to map the future of humanitarian aid.\n\n●     Organizing community-based mapping events that, for example, recently created geospatial data to help the city of Accra, Ghana, prepare for and respond to flooding.\n\n## **Smarter, efficient logistics**\n\nIn the United States, we're continuing to learn from the lead of the World Bank and the developing countries it is helping, especially when it comes to leveraging mapping data, weather data, telemetry data, data modeling and predictive analytics to bolster logistical efforts during disasters. For example:\n\n●     Transportation networks can be programmed to identify shelters and locations of key services.\n\n●     Government and public-service agency networks can pinpoint vulnerable populations, locate where people might be trapped, identify their evacuation routes and predict where they will gather based on such elements as topography and vulnerabilities of critical infrastructures. The Catholic Charities USA Disaster Operations map is a good example of this, as was this post-Hurricane Maria map of Puerto Rico.\n\n●     Maps can be updated in near real-time and with vivid detail to reflect changes in roads and pathways that disasters have altered, and which evacuation/escape routes are most crowded.\n\n●     Emergency response teams can better understand where they can and can't move, where food and goods are most needed and how to get them on the ground.\n\nThe unfortunate reality is that the frequency and severity of many types of natural disasters are only increasing. The fortunate news is that data-driven mapping, open communities, telemetry and analytics technologies will continue to evolve and enable streamlined logistical planning and more efficient disaster response.\n\nWant more content like this?

 'Stripe is a private company that offers merchants the ability to accept credit, debit and other payment methods on their online stores. The company is reportedly worth $20 billion based on a recent round of financing -- and a growing competitor to **Paypal Holdings Inc** (NASDAQ:PYPL), according to Guggenheim.\n\n### The Analyst\n\nGuggenheim\'s Jeff Cantwell maintains a Neutral rating on PayPal.\n\n### Stripe Vs. Paypal\n\nData collected by the research firm shows Stripe has grown its merchant base at 20 times the rate of PayPal\'s over the past three years, Cantwell said in a Monday note.\n\nPart of this can be attributed to PayPal\'s first-mover advantage and the "law of large numbers," but merchants are attracted to Stripe\'s highly customizable and competitively priced platform that offers non-payment related services, the analyst said. \n\nData also shows Stripe merchants account for around one-third the number of PayPal\'s merchants, which represents an increase of fivefold from three years ago, Cantwell said.\n\nPayPal remains the clear market leader, but Stripe is "narrowing that gap pretty quickly," since it offers the ability to accept other, non-PayPal payment methods, the analyst said. \n\n### Amazon Pay Vs. Paypal\n\n**Amazon.com, Inc.** (NASDAQ:AMZN)\'s payment processor Amazon Pay is also gaining traction against PayPal, Cantwell said.\n\nThe number of merchants accepting Amazon Pay has risen from nearly zero five years ago to about 4 percent of the number of PayPal merchants today, he said.\n\nGranted, "4 percent is still only 4 percent at the end of the day," but Amazon is likely to focus on how it can branch out of its own platform to serve more customers, the analyst said. Given Amazon\'s top ranking in customer satisfaction, the inclusion of Amazon Pay on non-Amazon merchant platforms could gain traction with consumers over the long-term, he said. \n\n### Price Action\n\nPayPal shares were up 0.68 percent at $96.63 at the time of publication Monday; Amazon shares were 0.33-percent higher at $1,636.91. \n\n_Related Links:  _\n\n_Cramer Explains How The\'Little Guy\' Benefits From Shopify, Square _\n\n_Guggenheim Downgrades PayPal On Likely Headwinds From Brexit, Payments Competition _\n\n_Photo courtesy of Venmo.  _\n\nAn **Amazon Prime**  (NASDAQ:AMZN) cargo jet operated by **Atlas Air Worldwide Holdings**  (NASDAQ:AAWW) crashed today near Trinity Bay near Anahuac, Texas, killing all three crewmembers, according to the Federal Aviation Administration.\n\nFlight 3591 was en route to Houston from Miami when it crashed about 35 miles outside of George Bush Intercontinental Airport, its final destination.

"Atlas Air is cooperating fully with the FAA and NTSB. We will update as additional information becomes available."\n\nAccording to flight tracking site Onemileatatime, the plane, with tail number N1217A, has previously been operated by Canadian Airlines, China Southern, and LAN before conversion to a cargo plane and acquired by Atlas Air.\n\nPurchase, N.Y.-based Atlas generates most of its revenue by flying freighter aircraft for airlines, the military, and other customers. It posted record revenue of $765 million, a 22-percent increase from the year-earlier period in the fourth quarter of 2018. On an adjusted basis, income from continuing operations, net of taxes, rose 31 percent to $87 million from adjusted income of $66 million. Adjusted EBITDA rose 21 percent to $196.5 million.\n\nWant more content like this?

The _Houston Chronicle_ identified them this afternoon as Capt. Sean Archuleta, Capt. Ricky Blakely and First Officer Conrad Jules Aska. In a statement today, Purchase, New York-based Atlas said it has established a Family Assistance Center staffed with specialists to support the families of the deceased. Atlas CEO William J. Flynn is on site with a team from the airline, it said.\n\nAtlas Air flight 3591 was operated for Seattle-based e-tailing giant **Amazon.com, Inc.** (NASDAQ:AMZN) as part of a contractual relationship in which Atlas provides aircraft, crew, maintenance and insurance services to Amazon. The relationship is better known by its acronym of "ACMI." Amazon has leased 20 Boeing 767-300s from Atlas for that purpose.\n\n Air traffic controllers lost radar and radio contact with the plane when it was about 30 miles southeast of the airport, The _Chronicle_ said, citing comments by the Federal Aviation Administration. The aircraft disintegrated upon impact, leaving what witnesses called total devastation. The _Chronicle_ reported earlier today that the largest piece that authorities had recovered was 50 feet long.\n\nDon\'t miss it. Register today.\n\nIn freighter configuration, the 767-300 model can carry up to 116,000 pounds of cargo. It is unclear at this time how much tonnage the plane was carrying. Jesse Cohen, a long-time airline executive and FreightWaves\' air cargo market expert, said the model is commonly used in air commerce, and is a "very capable and proven" mid-sized aircraft. Amazon, which uses the aircraft to transport goods ordered by its "Amazon Prime" customers, has so far agreed to lease 50 of the planes. Besides the 20 from Atlas, it has leased 30 from **Air Transport Services Group**  (NASDAQ:ATSG), an Atlas competitor.\n\nThe National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), which handles air, rail and pipeline accident investigations, has taken charge of the inquiry. Because the aircraft was a cargo plane, the NTSB will review the characteristics of the cargo on board to determine whether any of the parcels could have contained any kind of declared or undeclared dangerous goods, such as lithium-ion batteries, that have in the past been cited as the cause of aircraft incidents.\n\nWant more content like this?

 'In another sign of the increasing recognition Detroit is receiving for its entrepreneurial and tech scene, Forbes announced Tuesday that it\'s bringing its Under 30 Summit to the Motor City for the next three years.\n\nThe 2019 Under 30 Summit Detroit is set for Oct. 27-30 and is expected to draw almost 10,000 entrepreneurs to the city. The event is presented by Quicken Loans\' Rocket Mortgage.\n\n"If any day really symbolizes what we mean by the intersection of muscles and brains, that would be today," said Quicken Loans Chairman Dan Gilbert, referencing both Forbes\' three-year commitment to Detroit and **Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV**(NYSE:FCAU)\'s announcement earlier in the day of a $4.5-billion investment in Michigan.\n\nVenture capitalist and former America Online CEO Steve Case was instrumental in bringing the Forbes summit to Detroit by connecting the media company with Quicken Loans, Gilbert said.\n\n"You\'re going to see some great big ideas that are born here because of this event."\n\nDetroit Pistons power forward Blake Griffin made the cover of Forbes\' "30 Under 30" issue in November, and the magazine said 58 young Michigan entrepreneurs have made the list since 2015.\n\nTuesday\'s announcement was made at The Madison Building in Detroit. Other dignitaries who spoke included Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer and Wayne County Executive Warren Evans.\n\n__\n\n_Video courtesy of Quicken Loans._\n\n### \'The City Is Becoming More Entrepreneurial\'\n\nSince Quicken Loans relocated to downtown Detroit eight-and-a-half years ago, the number of company employees living in the city has risen from 73 to 4,000, Gilbert said.\n\n"We looked around and dreamed of a Detroit that would serve as a place for innovation and serve as an example for urban cores."\n\nThe Quicken Loans founder pointed out that tech companies such as **Alphabet Inc** (NASDAQ:GOOGL) (NASDAQ:GOOG), **Snap Inc** (NYSE:SNAP), **Amazon.com, Inc.**(NASDAQ:AMZN), **Microsoft Corporation** (NASDAQ:MSFT) and LinkedIn have established a presence in the city.\n\nBenzinga relocated its headquarters to downtown Detroit in 2015.\n\nDetroit Mayor Mike Duggan described being at dinner at the Shinola Hotel in downtown Detroit with Gilbert last week and stumbling upon an angel investor conference upstairs.\n\n"This is a time when the city is becoming more entrepreneurial," Duggan said.\n\n### What To Expect\n\nPast speakers and attendees at the Under 30 Summit include Richard Branson, founder of the Virgin Group; former Secretary of State and U.S. Sen.

 'A more sanguine interest rate outlook is among the reasons real estate stocks and exchange traded funds are bouncing back this year, but rates aren\'t the only factor to consider.\n\nSome real estate ETFs with a narrower focus on high-growth corners of the commercial real estate industry are crushing their more traditional rivals.\n\n### What Happened\n\nThe **Pacer Benchmark Industrial Real Estate SCTR ETF** (NYSE:INDS) is up 17.74 percent year-to-date while the MSCI US Investable Market Real Estate 25/50 Index and the Dow Jones U.S. Real Estate Index are up an average of 12.6 percent.\n\nINDS, the only ETF dedicated to industrial real estate investment trusts, follows the Benchmark Industrial Real Estate SCTR Index. That benchmark invests "in industrial REITs that are part of the e-commerce distribution and logistics networks along with self-storage facilities," according to Pacer.\n\n### Why It\'s Important\n\nThe e-commerce boom and the related real estate demands by companies such as **Amazon.com Inc.** (NASDAQ:AMZN) powering INDS and industrial REITs higher.\n\n"Despite the growth of e-commerce, it\'s still just a fraction of all retail sales," said Nareit. "U.S. e-commerce sales rose to $131 billion in the third quarter of 2018, a 15 percent increase from the same period a year earlier, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. Yet that still only represented 9.8 percent of all retail sales."\n\nInvestors looking to place this theme via ETFs need to turn to INDS and the reason is simple. The aforementioned MSCI US Investable Market Real Estate 25/50 Index and the Dow Jones U.S. Real Estate Index simply don\'t have large enough industrial REIT allocations to adequately take advantage of upside in those names. Industrial REITs are an average of 6.45 percent of those benchmarks.\n\n### What\'s Next\n\nDevelopers are scrambling to meet demands for more industrial real estate space. Last year, 262 million square feet of such space was introduced, up 9 percent from 2017, according to **Prologis Inc.** (NYSE:PLD), the largest holding in INDS with a weight of almost 15 percent.\n\n"Prologis Research projects 250 million square feet of net absorption and 260 million square feet of deliveries in 2019," said the company. "As a result, the vacancy rate should stabilize at its historic low of 4.5%, maintaining upward pressure on rental rates and making expansion challenging for customers in many markets."\n\nShares of Prologis and **Duke Realty Corp.** (NYSE:DRE), which combine for almost 30 percent of INDS\'s weight, are up an average of 18.1 percent this year.\n\n_Related Links_\n\n_Free ETFs Are Coming_\n\n_A Powerful Pharma ETF_\n\nOn the domestic economic front, 2018 will likely be remembered as a landmark year for a variety of reasons. Equity markets experienced their most volatile year in a decade, housing prices soared to highs they hadn\'t seen since the real estate market collapsed, and the first major tax reform in 30 years was officially implemented, pushing the corporate tax rate to its lowest level since 1938.\n\nHowever, in the midst of these headline-grabbing economic trends, the U.S. Federal Open Market Committee was making what were possibly the most broadly impactful of these fiscal changes, raising the federal funds rate one hundred basis points.\n\nThis marked the first year since 2006 that the committee increased interest rates by a full percent, and also signaled the end of the body\'s "accommodative" policies toward growth, which means the end of quantitative easing and the slow unwinding of the Federal Reserve\'s balance book.\n\n### **So What Does This Meaning For Lending?**\n\nDespite the Fed\'s more hawkish policies over the past few years, inflation has so far not posed much of a threat. Liquidity is still out there even as borrowers and lenders are getting accustomed to even modestly elevated interest rates\n\nWhich might be one reason businesses have gotten so anxious about investing into a potentially uncertain economic future. Even with the tax breaks and a huge uptick in spending, traditional financial institutions saw only modest growth to their loan portfolios over the year, with most of their tax windfall flowing to their investors.\n\nThe Federal Reserve has seemingly acknowledged this anxiety, as well as the lack of alarming inflation signals, halting its pattern of increases to the federal funds rate.\n\nBut, despite the supposed anxiety, business lenders are still seeing strong growth on the back of lending demand. Fintech lender Credibly, which specializes in small business financing, securitized its loan portfolio late last year in the wake of rising interest rates. This not only made the debt an investable asset, but also broadened the company\'s potential lending capacity.\n\nThe positioning of fintechs like Credibly could serve as an important indicator of just how much gas is really left in the fiscal tanks among the real drivers of the economy.\n\nBut that forces the question: is 2018\'s liquidity party really over?\n\n### **From Monsoons, New Rivers Flow**\n\nThe short answer is no.\n\nThe slightly longer answer is that, in spite of an inevitable fall from 2018\'s high water mark, spending conditions are still extremely favorable for companies, especially those in the U.S.\n\nFor example, giant tech names like **Alphabet Inc.** (NASDAQ:GOOG) and **Amazon.com Inc**(NASDAQ:AMZN) still anticipate a massive amount capital spending in 2019, well above 2017 levels. And, while sentiment indicators like the National Federation of Independent Business\' small business optimism index shows a sharp drop-off between 2018 and 2019, additional signals like employee hires and capex spending remain historically strong.\n\nAnd, if you use fintech as a bellwether, alternative lending remains among the most in-demand services among small businesses seeking financing as well as traditional banks looking to expand their business. The need for competitive technological solutions to effective lending was one of the prime reasons behind the **BB &T Corporation **(NYSE:BBT) **SunTrust Banks, Inc.** (NYSE:STI) deal, one of the biggest bank mergers in history.\n\nAt the same time, small business lenders like Credibly, Kabbage and Fundbox, continue to expand their own product lines, with the former set to launch a new small business line of credit product over the course of the year. Credibly intends this new line of credit to create more fluid financing options for companies.\n\nThe point is, 2019 might not hold the same promise of the money pit that 2018 turned out to be, but all signs point to a year of solid spending and expansion, especially for those who know where to look.\n\n_Credibly is a content partner of Benzinga_'
 'Freight tech has become one of the hottest venture capital marketplaces in the business world, with investment dollars in startups growing 24x from 2014 to 2018, when nearly $3 billion poured into the space. Much of this investment was dedicated to the transportation side of the logistics industry: freight matching, optimizing asset utilization, new transportation management system platforms, track-and-trace technology, and cloud-based analytics products.\n\nYet something is missing: the warehouse and distribution center side. In our view, far less attention has been paid to the need to gain visibility into facility operations, collect and analyze data, and re-imagine facilities, processes, and people with artificially-intelligent assistants. Warehouses and distribution centers have been relatively neglected despite extraordinarily high costs.\n\nA February 2019 study by Coresight Research and Celect, which analyzed survey responses from 200 senior decision-makers at U.S. retailers, found that companies relying upon manual data entry and communication processes overbought, bought the wrong SKU, or underbought inventory at rates exceeding their tech-enabled competitors. The result is a massive destruction of capital every year.\n\n"We estimate that markdowns cost US non-grocery retailers approximately $300 billion in revenues in 2018, equivalent to around 12% of all US non-grocery retail sales," wrote Deborah Weinswig, CEO and founder of Coresight Research.\n\nJust 60 percent of non-grocery retail sales are made at full price, the study found, in large part because product is not efficiently delivered to the point of sale when it is demanded. Apparel sales are especially vulnerable to time delays and erroneous orders of the wrong product.\n\n"Misjudgments regarding inventory account for a total of 53% of unplanned markdown costs for retailers, according to our survey results," Weinswig wrote. Other contributors to markdown costs cited by the survey respondents included external factors like unseasonal weather, sudden changes in consumer behavior, and competitors\' unplanned promotional activities.\n\nThe chart below shows the disadvantage faced by retailers relying on basic data entry and manual input tools:\n\n"It is critical that retailers are empowered to make decisive, intelligent orders from their suppliers," said Chris Kirchner, Co-Founder and CEO of Slync. "The lack of visibility and prediction in inventory management is destroying capital and compressing revenues across retail verticals."\n\nSlync\'s supply chain platform pulls data from wholesale suppliers, retail distribution networks, transportation companies, e-commerce portals, and brick-and-mortar stores, cleans it, and aggregates it on the cloud. From there, machine learning algorithms and artificially intelligent helpers aid human decision-makers in predicting which SKUs will be in demand, the best way for the retailer to source them, and how quickly and inexpensively they can be brought to the consumer.\n\nAdding to the complications that retailers face in their distribution center networks are the sea-changes wrought by e-commerce. New warehouses are smaller and are being built closer to population centers; not only that, but the throughput they need to achieve an acceptable return on capital is high, compared to traditional warehouse facilities.\n\nWarehouse employment has exploded in the last decade--really in the last five years--despite very low unemployment in the broader economy, putting pressure on supply chain participants to increase productivity (which means increasing throughput faster than headcount). Leading companies in supply chain technology are paving the way forward, but progress is unevenly distributed--there\'s a long tail of retail shippers who have not benefited from the latest technology and who are at risk of falling behind.\n\nAt Stifel\'s Transportation and Logistics Conference in Miami Beach earlier this month, Freightos VP Ori Franco related an interesting anecdote about Amazon.\n\n"**Amazon.com, Inc.** \'s (NASDAQ:AMZN) CFO measures warehouse capacity in cubic feet, not square feet," Franco said. Clearly, the e-commerce retailer exploits available space more intensively than its competitors. Amazon is literally playing 3D chess when it comes to warehouse operations.\n\nLast summer, Korber Logistics Systems acquired Centriq, consolidating voice-recognition and three-dimensional warehouse modeling technology companies. RightHand, a robotic picker startup, raised a $23 million B round in December. Amazon itself has already deployed more than 100,000 robotic drive-units, which grab containers and reposition them for picking and stowage.\n\nThere is obvious interest in robotically powered warehouse operations, but the majority of retailers are not ready for that. Capital-intensive robotics systems need a high return on investment to justify themselves, but a company can only tell its robots what to do if it has the data. That\'s where integration layers like Slync\'s platform come in.\n\n"Slync is designed to accelerate time-to-decision for any company involved in the supply chain, and we believe leveraging our platform in warehouse and DC operations will generate immediate returns for our customers," Kirchner said.\n\nWant more content like this?
