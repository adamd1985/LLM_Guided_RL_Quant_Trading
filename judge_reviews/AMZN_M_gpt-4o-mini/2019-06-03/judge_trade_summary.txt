Based on the provided market data and news, predict the LLMâ€™s decision:
News Factors Considered:
['Research and development surrounding the use of artificial intelligence has skyrocketed in the past few years, with advancements from big companies like**Amazon.com, Inc.** (NASDAQ:AMZN) and **Google** (NASDAQ:GOOGL). One tenacious player from the Midwest, Clinc Inc., is competing for the top spot in customer interaction and AI technology.\n\n### What Happened\n\nThe Ann Arbor-based startup announced Monday that it raised $52 million in a Series B financing round led by Insight Partners, DFJ Growth, Drive Capital and Hyde Park Venture Partners, according to Crain\'s Detroit Business. \n\nThe company has demonstrated substantial growth since its inception in 2015.\n\nIn 2018, Clinc reported a 300-percent increase in revenue and announced that its technology reaches over 30 million consumers in industries like health care, automotive, banking and more, according to Venture Beat. \n\n"We\'ve had phenomenal growth and built unbelievable momentum in a very short period of time," CEO Jason Mars told Crain\'s. \n\n### Why It\'s Important\n\nCEO Mars and COO Lingjia Tang, a husband-and-wife team, both serve as assistant professors at the University of Michigan and research cutting-edge advancements for the AI landscape.\n\nIn August 2018, another Ann Arbor-based startup, Duo Security, was purchased by **Cisco Systems, Inc.** (NASDAQ:CSCO) in a $2.35-billion deal. \n\n### What\'s Next\n\nClinc\'s funding will be allocated primarily to product development, a feat that has become imperative with the growing team.\n\nClinc anticipates expanding the team from 75 to 140 employees, with plans to move into a new, bigger building in Ann Arbor, accoridng to Crain\'s. \n\nThe company\'s goal is to go public in 2022, the report said. \n\n"This is a key milestone for us. My intention is for this to be the last milestone before we have an IPO," Mars told Crain\'s.\n\n_Related Links:_\n\n_How A Group Of Academics Open-Sourced Conversational AI_\n\n_Microsoft, Sony Team Up To Work On Gaming Experiences, AI Solutions_\n\nBrian Grandolf (not his real name) frantically cleaned his new home office, making room for the desk he ordered online to arrive and complete the space. Having already started his new job, and currently working at his kitchen table, Grandolf couldn\'t wait to set up the desk.\n\nWhen the last-mile delivery company truck pulled up streetside - three days after it was supposed to arrive - the driver quickly assessed the situation and realized that the pallet jack would never climb the three steps onto the porch, much less squeeze through the front door. Content that his job was done after unloading the pallet to the front lawn, the driver asked for a signature. Grandolf argued, "how was he supposed to lift the 200-pound box into the house by himself?"\n\nThe driver relented and assisted Grandolf in bringing the box into the home, where it was then noticed that the box, and part of the desk, was damaged. Noting such on the delivery receipt -  Grandolf was reluctant to reject the shipment after delays in receiving it - the task turned to working with the original shipper to make good on the damage.\n\nIn Grandolf\'s case, the shipper stood behind the product and quickly sent out a replacement part, but many Americans are not so lucky. With that online furniture purchase comes many risks, including damage and the possibility that the manufacturer is not as accommodating as the one who assisted Grandolf. Still, more Americans are turning to online buying for big-ticket purchase\n\n## Online furniture sales growing\n\nLast year, U.S. e-commerce sales topped $605 billion, growing 15 percent from the year prior. Furniture and home furnishings are the fastest growing segment of e-commerce. According to eMarketer, U.S. e-commerce sales in this category were expected to hit $50.32 billion, a growth rate of 18 percent for 2018. In 2017, **Amazon.com, Inc.** (NASDAQ:AMZN) reported $4 billion in furniture sales, according to a One Click Retail study.\n\nIt is because of this continued growth that carriers are increasingly devoting resources to last-mile furniture delivery. Earlier this year, **J.B. Hunt Transport Services Inc  **(NASDAQ:JBHT) acquired Cory 1st Choice Home Delivery, a New Jersey-based provider specializing in delivery of large and bulky items. The acquisition, just the third in company history, greatly enhanced  J.B. Hunt Final Mile\'s furniture delivery expertise, adding a great number of contract carriers to its base of available capacity and broadening its service offerings to meet consumer demand. Services include drop-off and white glove deliveries where drivers will enter a customer\'s home and, in many cases, even set up the item.\n\nThe reason companies like J.B. Hunt are expanding their last-mile delivery of furniture is the potential, noting that "large format home delivery" is a $13 billion market right now. Its Final Mile business made more than two million home deliveries in 2018. Adding a company like Cory only enhances that business.\n\n"Consumers expect the right balance of service, speed, and price, so we\'re building our furniture delivery program to help customers meet that demand," Nick Hobbs, executive vice president and president of Dedicated Contract Services at J.B. Hunt, said. "The right experience can lead to a consumer, and possibly their friends, purchasing more merchandise from a particular vendor, ultimately generating more business for all of us."\n\n## Transparent ordering and delivery process\n\nThe key to successful last-mile delivery of large format items such as furniture is the ease and simplicity of the entire process, from the efficiency of scheduling delivery to the transparency of tracking the shipment. Grandolf only knew his desk would arrive within a three-day window. Thanks to Amazon, though, customers expect more visibility into their delivery.\n\nThis process starts with how the delivery provider presents itself. Are drivers uniformed? Are they properly trained to make the delivery, to assemble and install products if needed, and, most importantly, to treat the customer and their home with care and respect? Is the equipment clean and clearly labeled?\n\nIn terms of the delivery itself, does the delivery company provide track-and-trace capabilities? Does it offer value-added services such as deluxing and repair? Does it arrive when it says it will?\n\nGrandolf\'s provider checked off very few of these boxes, and while the retailer ultimately made good on the sale by sending replacement parts, the entire experience soured him on ordering from that company again. Retailers need to be sure they work with companies that check these boxes, because for most customers, the only contact they see is the delivery person. A positive ordering experience can be ruined by a bad delivery experience, and in some cases, the customer may never return. Grandolf is a case-in-point.\n\n## Follow up should be standard practice\n\nAs with many larger delivery companies, most consumers will receive a follow-up survey after a delivery by J.B. Hunt Final Mile. This gives the provider an opportunity to atone for any missteps made in the process, correct concerns going forward, and be recognized for a job well done.\n\nIt\'s easy for retailers to go with the lowest-priced delivery provider, especially when free shipping is promised the consumer, but the lasting effects of a bad experience due to an unprepared delivery company will do more long-term harm than simply paying a slightly higher cost.\n\nLast-mile delivery companies are now working to differentiate themselves based on service offerings. With millennials making up 37 percent of furniture shoppers, and increasingly shopping online, last-mile delivery is only going to increase.\n\nThe providers need to keep up.\n\nImage sourced from Pixabay\n\nThe latest round of funding for U.K. food delivery start-up Deliveroo is being helmed by a familiar face - **Amazon.com, Inc.  **(NASDAQ:AMZN).\n\nThe Seattle-based e-tailer is leading a $575 million "Series G\' round that includes mutual fund giants Fidelity and T. Rowe Price, as well as Greenoaks Capital, an I.T investment firm, a venture capital company. The round brings to $1.53 billion that Deliveroo has raised to date, the U.K. firm said Friday. Deliveroo operates in 14 countries.\n\nDeliveroo said in a statement that it will use the funding to expand its information technology operations at its London headquarters, and to refine a service called "Editions," which encourages existing restaurateurs and food operators to open "virtual brands" as extensions of their existing kitchens. It added that it wants to help restaurants build footprints in local neighborhoods with what it termed "low cost, low risk" programs.\n\nAmazon would not comment beyond the**** announcement that was published on Deliveroo\'s website. Amazon\'s one experience with U.K. food delivery was not especially positive - it closed its London delivery business, "Takeaways," in November 2018 after two years. Ironically, one of the factors that led to the demise of the business was the fierce competition from Deliveroo.\n\nBrittain Ladd, who spent two years at Amazon as an executive in e-commerce and cross-border strategy before forming a consultancy, said Friday that Amazon will take an "active role" in Deliveroo\'s operations but that "it will do so quietly. In a piece earlier this week published on the website "Observer," Ladd said that all of Amazon\'s moves, whether it be one-day delivery for its "Prime" customers or the $14 billion acquisition of high-end grocer Whole Foods Market in June 2017, is geared toward one objective - building the nation\'s largest and most integrated logistics network" where inventory will be held anywhere imaginable.\n\n"Every process within the chain of fulfilling an order will be automated," Ladd wrote. "Amazon will leverage its mastery of data to create a living supply chain that anticipates demand, making it easier for Amazon to meet demand.\n\nThe end-game, according to Ladd, is to create the "most advanced network of logistics facilities and physical retail locations where inventory can be deployed rapidly and cost-effectively to meet customer demand in minutes, not hours or days."\n\nImage sourced from Pixabay\n\nInvestors are starting their week off confronted by continuing tensions between the U.S. and China, as the trade dispute lingers and fallout from President Trump\'s blacklisting of Chinese telecom giant Huawei widens.\n\nGoogle parent **Alphabet Inc** (NASDAQ:GOOG) has suspended some business with the Chinese telecom company. GOOG\'s shares were down more than 1%. And Bloomberg reported that chipmakers including **Intel Corporation**  (NASDAQ:INTC), **Qualcomm, Inc.**  (NASDAQ:QCOM), **Xilinx, Inc.  **(NASDAQ:XLNX), and **Broadcom Inc** (NASDAQ:AVGO) told employees they won\'t supply Huawei until further notice. Shares of those companies were down between 2% and 5% in pre-market trading this morning.\n\nThe news comes after tensions with China ratcheted up last week after President Trump signed an executive order saying U.S. firms can\'t use telecom equipment from companies that pose a national security risk, a move broadly seen as targeting Huawei. And the Commerce Department added Huawei to a list requiring the company get government approval to acquire components and technology from U.S. firms.\n\nThe Huawei fallout creates a wild card that that market isn\'t loving as it seems like Trump\'s blacklisting of the company is beyond a bargaining chip in the wider trade war. It seems likely that any deal that might get struck won\'t come soon, like many in the market had been thinking. \n\nThis morning\'s stock market action comes after CNBC reported late in the trading session on Friday that trade talks between the United States and China have stalled. The news comes after the United States raised tariffs on $200 billion of Chinese goods, and China, in retaliation, announced increased tariffs on U.S. goods that are scheduled to start in June.\n\nStill, swings in the market seem to be getting smaller, perhaps a sign that the new normal of prolonged uncertainty about a trade deal between the world\'s two biggest economies has generally been priced into the market. \n\nIt could also mean that investors are getting tariffed out. That fatigue could be a double-edged sword as on the one hand market participants may be paying more attention to company fundamentals, such as earnings. But, on the other hand, not paying enough attention to a big issue like the trade war could lead the market to get taken by surprise, which tends to be a negative for stocks. \n\n### Data and Earnings Week for Homebuilding and Retail\n\nLooking ahead, the economic calendar is relatively light this week. But there are still some data on tap during the week that will likely be of interest to investors and traders.\n\nExisting home sales for April are due out on Tuesday, while new home sales data for the month are scheduled for Thursday. And durable goods orders for April are on the calendar for Friday. \n\nFed minutes are also scheduled for release this week, and investors may want to parse through them to try to glean more insight into the central bank\'s thoughts on the economy.\n\nWhile earnings season is almost over, this week still has plenty to offer in terms of corporate reports. \n\nA bevy of clothing and footwear retailers is expected to report earnings this week, including **J.C. Penney Company Inc**  (NYSE:JCP), **Kohl \'s Corporation** (NYSE:KSS), **TJX Companies Inc** (NYSE:TJX), **Nordstrom, Inc.**  (NYSE:JWN), **L Brands Inc**  (NYSE:LB), **Ross Stores, Inc.** (NASDAQ:ROST), and **Foot Locker, Inc.** (NYSE:FL). (See more on retailers below.)\n\nThose companies fall under the Consumer Discretionary sector. So their results and comments from their executives could help paint a clearer pictures of what kind of mood the U.S. shopper is in. It could also shed more light into the shift from traditional brick-and-mortar business to online retailers and let us know how some of these companies are competing with **Amazon.com, Inc.** (NASDAQ:AMZN).\n\n**Home Depot Inc** (NYSE:HD), **Lowe \'s Companies Inc** (NYSE:LOW), and **Toll Brothers Inc**  (NYSE:TOL) are also expected to report, and these businesses could give us a glimpse into the housing market in addition to the existing and new home sales data.\n\nMeanwhile, **Target Corporation** (NYSE:TGT) is also expected to report earnings this week. While you can certainly shop for clothes at Target stores, the company also sells a host of goods that put it in the Consumer Staples category. This slightly different sector of the economy tends to be viewed as a defensive play because companies in it can often still do well even in an economic downturn because people need their household goods regardless of how the economy is doing.\n\n**Figure 1: Gold Dulls** : Gold prices (candlestick chart) retreated on Friday as strong consumer sentiment data (see below) boosted the U.S. dollar (line chart). A stronger dollar can dampen demand for dollar-denominated gold by making it more expensive for buyers holding other currencies. The U.S.-China trade tensions have also been helping the dollar. Data Source: Chart source: The thinkorswimÂ® platform from TD Ameritrade. _For illustrative purposes only. Past performance does not guarantee future results_.  \n\n**Consumer Sentiment** : On Friday, trade tensions outweighed some positive U.S. economic data. The University of Michigan\'s consumer sentiment index for early May came in at 102.4, well above the 96.9 expected in a Briefing.com consensus estimate. That was the highest reading in 15 years. "Consumers viewed prospects for the overall economy much more favorably, with the economic outlook for the near and longer term reaching their highest levels since 2004," the university said. However, the increase in the index was mostly recorded before the U.S.-China trade talks collapsed and China responded by announcing its own increased tariffs. We\'ll have to wait until May 31 for the release of final May data to see if the developments have weighed on consumer sentiment. \n\n**Retailers and Tariffs** : The same University of Michigan report also noted that even aside from the direct impact that tariffs have on prices, increased tariffs "could cause a more general loss of confidence which could further diminish the pace of consumer spending." **Goldman Sachs Group Inc** (NYSE:GS) analysts said recently in a note that U.S businesses and households have born the entirety of the costs of tariffs. And a **Walmart Inc** (NYSE:WMT) executive said rising tariffs will make goods more expensive for shoppers, while a **Macy \'s Inc** (NYSE:M) executive warned that another round of U.S. tariff hikes would impact apparel and accessories categories. If Trump does impose tariffs on a $300 billion swath of goods, as he has threatened, that round of duties would cover clothing, shoes and other consumer items. This comes at a time when brick-and-mortar retailers are already getting squeezed by AMZN, and it remains to be seen how much of the increased costs these businesses would be able to pass on to their consumers. With the threat of the pain getting spread around, it may be worth listening in this week to see if more retail executives discuss the tariff issue. \n\n**Japan \'s GDP Surprise: **In a counterpoint to the doom-and-gloom investors have been worrying about with the world\'s two largest economies, its third largest appears to be doing surprisingly well. Japan\'s gross domestic product rose at an annual rate of 2.1% in the first quarter. That handily beat the median estimate of a contraction of 0.2% expected in a Reuters poll. Still, the surprise surge may not worth getting really excited about. It comes as imports fell faster than exports, which isn\'t a good sign for domestic demand. It\'s also not a great sign for exports; it just happens that they didn\'t fall as much as imports.\n\n_Information from TDA is not intended to be investment advice or construed as a recommendation or endorsement of any particular investment or investment strategy, and is for illustrative purposes only.

 '**Amazon.com, Inc.** (NASDAQ:AMZN) is flying into Lakeland, Florida in a big way.\n\nThe e-tailing giant will spend more than $100 million to build a 285,000-square foot air cargo facility at Lakeland Linder International Airport, under a 20-year deal unanimously approved on May 20 by the Lakeland City Commission. The blueprint calls for Amazon to lease 47 acres to build a seven-jet cargo hangar, with an option to expand on an additional 62 acres. Amazon will pay the city about $80,000 per month, and would pay the airport 85 cents for every 1,000 pounds of landed cargo as well as a 3 cent-per- gallon fuel surcharge. The airport in turn would be expected to upgrade its landing system, improve one of its runways and add five fuel tanks.\n\nAfter the initial 20-year period, Amazon has the option to renew the lease three times, each time for a 10-year cycle.\n\nService is expected to begin by July 2020, according to a story in _The Ledger_ , a local newspaper which first reported the story on May 17 when the city released documents concerning the deal. It is unclear if Amazon will phase out nearby operations in Tampa, where it currently operates seven to eight flights per day. An Amazon spokeswoman confirmed the news about the Lakeland project. She did not comment on the status of the company\'s Tampa operations.\n\nAmazon opened a 1 million square foot sorting facility in Lakeland in 2014 that is down the street from the proposed complex. The company approached the city in July 2017 about the new project, said Gene Conrad, director of Linder Airport, according to _The Ledger_.\n\nNestled on Interstate 4 about halfway between Tampa and Orlando, Lakeland is home to Saddle Creek Logistics Services, a large third-party logistics provider (3PL) which works to support operations of shipper customers, and the American Logistics Aid Network, a non-profit organization that connects companies with logistics resources to groups providing relief in the aftermath of disasters. It is also the home to the Publix grocery chain and the spring training site of the Detroit Tigers Major League Baseball club.\n\nThe airport houses the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration\'s (NOAA) "Hurricane Hunters." The agency has a huge presence in Lakeland, according to Kevin Cook, a spokesman for the city. The airport is also home to Draken International, the largest air combat training contractor in the U.S., Cook said.\n\nThe Amazon facility is expected to come to dominate the city\'s economic landscape, according to comments in _The Ledger_ article.\n\nAmazon is aggressively building out its U.S. air network to support delivery commitments made for its popular "Prime" service. Today, the company guarantees two-day deliveries for millions of items on its website. However, it has announced plans to migrate to a one-day delivery standard, a dramatic compression of delivery times that is likely to amplify the importance of the company\'s air network.\n\nImage sourced from Pixabay\n\nTorii CEO Uri Haramati has announced that his company, which offers a platform for software-as-a-service (SaaS) management, was able to secure $3.5 million in a successful seed round.\n\n  \nHaramati spoke publicly for the first time about the round during his presentation at the Collision Conference in Toronto. Part of the "Breakout Startups" session on Tuesday morning, Torii was featured alongside additional exciting tech ventures handpicked by leading investors. Other SaaS companies that appeared included collaboration platform Hugo and voice app design platform Voiceflow.\n\n  \nWith Collision being one of North America\'s top technology conferences, the segment comes as a welcome development for the SaaS space as it affirms that investors are warming up to SaaS once again.\n\n  \nTorii offers a management solution that makes SaaS use more visible to administrators by automatically discovering SaaS applications being used within a company\'s network. The platform also allows It managers to oversee access to applications through onboarding and offboarding features.\n\n  \nThe round was led by Silicon Valley venture fund Uncork Capital and also involved Global Founders Capital and Entree Capital. The fresh capital raised is set to bolster Torii\'s efforts to integrate better mechanisms for workflow automation. The company also looks to allocate more funding to its US-based commercial activities.\n\n### Renewed Interest in SaaS\n\nInvestments in SaaS have been bearish since 2016, but this outlook seems to have flipped. Just this April alone, around $200 million had been invested in SaaS startups.\n\n  \nWe\'ve also seen some significant acquisitions of SaaS companies in the IT space so far this year. Disaster recovery service CloudEndure was acquired by **Amazon.com, Inc.** (NASDAQ:AMZN) for $200 million. Apptio also recently announced its acquisition of Cloudability, its third purchase in just two years.\n\n  \nTorii\'s successful seed round only affirms the trend. The participation of a top funds like Uncork Capital, which is among the most respected VC shops in Silicon Valley, underscores that opportunities are truly present in the space.\n\n  \n"We chose to invest in Torii because we loved the team, the product, the early traction, and the market," said Andy McLoughlin of Uncork Capital, whose firm\'s portfolio includes big tech company names like SendGrid, About.me, Bitly, Fitbit, Eventbrite and Mint. "The three founders are experienced tech innovators - they bring valuable experience working in high growth businesses, coupled with developing consumer products."\n\n### SaaS Continues to See Booming Adoption \n\nAccording to Gartner, public cloud adoption is expected to continue its upward trajectory. By 2022, the total market for public cloud services is set to hit $331.2 billion worldwide. SaaS is expected to account for over 43 percent of the market, contributing $143.7 billion in revenue.\n\n  \nConsumers and line-of-business users are also shifting many of their daily activities to online and mobile, prompting businesses to aggressively digitize their processes. This widespread digital transformation of businesses is greatly contributing to cloud and SaaS growth. By 2020, 41 percent of workloads are set to run on public cloud platforms.\n\n  \nSaaS applications are distributed as browser-based app experiences, which has made technology once only accessible to enterprises more accessible to smaller operations and individual users.\n\n  \nDepartments can now fit software acquisition to be part of their own operating expenses. This has also shortened the time across decision, purchasing, and implementation. As such, IT decision makers are now likely to prefer SaaS solutions over conventional licensed software.\n\n****\n\n### Addressing Demand for Better Management \n\nRising SaaS adoption, however, has created new challenges for organizations to overcome. It has caused "shadow IT" - the use of devices and applications that are undisclosed to the IT department - to grow unchecked within organizations.\n\n  \nShadow IT can introduce various risks for companies, top among which are cybersecurity threats. The use of poorly secured applications exposes them to possible hacks and data breaches. Should their data be stolen through these unsecure third parties, not only are they looking at the cost of data loss, but they can also face fines and penalties for non-compliance with privacy regulations.\n\n  \nShadow IT can also result in unnecessary spending from redundant subscriptions. Poor integration mechanisms across these applications can also result in data silos which can degrade data integrity and disrupt workflows.\n\n  \nIT teams need to stay on top of all applications and subscriptions running within their respective organizations. These concerns only contribute to the growing demand for effective management tools specifically designed for SaaS, which represents a major opportunity for providers to offer solutions that address these issues.\n\n  \n"Companies can no longer afford to grant third-party tools access to their databases without knowing for sure that sensitive information won\'t be vulnerable to interception or sold to the highest bidder," Torii CEO Haramati said. "As part of their security mandates, IT leaders need to make sure that all software products in use at their companies are mapped, tracked and vetted."\n\n  \nInvestors and startups would do well recognizing that offering services that are integral and supportive of SaaS adoption appear to be a solid premise for success.\n\nImage sourced from Pixabay\n\nGood day,\n\nSaudi Arabia said it has completed its first shipment powered by blockchain under Saudi Customs pilot program with TradeLens. TradeLens is a joint program from Maersk (CXE: MAERB) and **IBM**(NYSE:IBM) to develop blockchain technology for shipping.\n\nThe Saudi Customs department announced a shipment left Dammam Port in Saudi Arabia and successfully arrived in Rotterdam on May 13. All the paperwork and data with that shipment was handled by blockchain through TradeLens.\n\n"To establish the Kingdom as one of the world\'s premier logistics hub we needed to create a paradigm shift in the way we handle our shipping processes and explore futuristic approaches with our peer-to-peer business ecosystem worldwide," said H.E Mr. Ahmed Al-Hakbani, Governor of Saudi Customs. "We hope our pilot program will stand the test of time to include other ports as well, and not just the route of exporting but importing also. We chose to embark on this tech journey knowing that change is uncomfortable, but it is inevitable to be a leading global player."\n\nDuring the test, the container\'s packing list and commercial invoice was uploaded by the customer to the TradeLens platform in a structured format, with their export customs broker using the data in the documents to submit export declaration to Saudi customs. The shipment\'s information was then accessed and used by Saudi Customs to register the clearance. \n\nThe container was loaded onboard Maersk Sebarok, transshipped in the Port of Tangier and then sent on to Rotterdam, where Dutch Port Community System Portbase provided Dutch Customs release messages and gate-out information directly to the TradeLens platform. Next the container was transported by truck to a location close to Antwerp, Belgium, and its final destination.\n\nThe entire process was handled through the TradeLens platform using blockchain.\n\n## **Did you know?**\n\nTo date, approximately 75 percent of comments filed in response to the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration\'s proposal to lower the interstate driving age for a commercial driver\'s license to 18 have been against the effort.\n\n## **Quotable:**\n\n"We\'re very excited about thisâ€¦.It\'s a big win not just for TuSimple, but for the whole industry."\n\n_Robert Brown, director of public affairs for autonomous vehicle startup TuSimple, which announced it will conduct road tests in conjunction with the United States Postal Service_\n\n## In other news:\n\n**Kenworth trucks recalled**\n\nMore than 1,800 Kenworth T680 and T880 trucks from model years 2018 through 2020 have been recalled due to a parking brake issue.

Blockchain was all the hype in 2017-2018, but without any clear projects providing success, some have wondered if the technology is over-hyped. Maybe, but real-world successes like this one will help regain the trust in blockchain and hopefully invigorate others to attempt their own projects.\n\nHammer down everyone!\n\nImage sourced from Pixabay\n\nOn CNBC\'s "Mad Money Lightning Round," Jim Cramer said **Intrexon Corp** (NASDAQ:XON) is a loser and he doesn\'t want to hear about it.\n\n**Iridium Communications Inc** (NASDAQ:IRDM) is a winner, said Cramer.

 '**Kohl \'s Corporation** (NYSE:KSS) shares plummeted Tuesday after reporting a first-quarter earnings miss. A couple of analysts weigh in on what to do with the stock moving forward.\n\n### **Staying Positive**\n\n"We see good value at current levels--with reset estimates supporting more attractive risk/reward--but we expect valuation to remain under pressure until Kohl\'s demonstrates comp re-acceleration," Baird analyst Mark Altschwager wrote in a note.\n\nAltschwager said Kohl\'s has differentiated itself in an evolving retail landscape with its innovative thinking and robust omni-channel platform, but following a successful 2018 the path to growth looks steeper.\n\n"Kohl\'s will need to demonstrate that last year\'s outperformance was driven as much by internal initiatives/momentum as the more favorable external backdrop," he said. He added that growth is expected to resume in the second half as the **Amazon.com, Inc.** (NASDAQ:AMZN) returns program and new brands ramp.\n\nAltschwager maintained an Outperform rating and lowered his price target from $80 to $70.\n\n### **Staying Neutral**\n\nWedbush analyst Jen Redding maintained a Neutral rating on Kohl\'s, lowering her price target from $65 to $58.\n\n"Margin trends in the first quarter reflected an unfavorable shift between spring and fall merchandise, while higher digital penetration added to shipping costs. Unfavorable weather, underperformance in the Home Category, and less productive promotional events depressed business vs. expectations," Redding wrote in a note.\n\nKohl\'s closed down another 3.1 percent at $53.44 per share.\n\n_Related Links:_\n\n_Bought Something On Amazon?

If true, Amazon could threaten the control of the European express market by the triumvirate of DHL, **UPS Inc  **(NYSE:UPS) and **FedEx Corporation  **(NYSE:FDX).\n\nEurope is not necessarily the largest express market, but it is one of the largest cross-border markets.\n\nAccording to Cross-Border Commerce, a European network and knowledge platform for all eCommerce and omni-channel players, 23 percent of European e-commerce is cross-border, estimated at 137 billion euros, a 13.2 percent increase from 2017.\n\nAmazon expanded its online retail platform into Europe in its early days. In terms of net sales, Germany and the U.K. are among the company\'s largest markets outside of the U.S. Amazon achieved year-over-year growth in 2018 net sales in those two countries of 17.3 percent and 27.7 percent respectively.\n\nRumors began swirling in late 2015 that Amazon was working with DB Schenker and using a wet-leased Boeing 737 freighter operated by charter carrier ASL France to connect cities in Poland, Germany and the U.K. Indeed, Cargo Facts confirmed that a Boeing 737 was being operated by ASL on a Monday-Saturday, six times weekly schedule between Wroclaw, Poland, Doncaster, U.K., and Kassel, Germany. All three of these cities are located near Amazon\'s fulfillment centers.\n\nIn 2016, ASL France\'s parent company, ASL Aviation Group, formally finalized its purchase of TNT Express, which included the Belgian subsidiary TNT Airways and Pan Air Lineas Aereas, based in Spain. In addition, ASL also signed a multi-year service agreement to operate flights for the combined FedEx/TNT entity. At the time, ASL\'s CEO said that the company hoped to fly 10 aircraft on a regular basis for Amazon. ASL Aviation was, at that point, providing Amazon with airlift mainly out of Poland to the U.K. and Italy to Germany.\n\nASL is a fascinating company and one that appears similar to U.S.-based ATSG and Atlas. According to its website, ASL consists of multiple companies including six airlines (seven airline operations), maintenance facilities and a number of leasing entities. ASL\'s airlines operate under their own brands and they also operate passenger and cargo networks on behalf of major international customers including express freight integrators and passenger airlines. In February 2019, European fund management company STAR Capital Partnership LLP signed an agreement to acquire 51 percent of ASL Aviation Holdings DAC.\n\n**" It\'s \'fantastical\' to think Amazon Air is a threat."**\n\n- FedEx CEO Fred Smith (December 20, 2018)\n\nIs it? Mr. Smith may want to think again. According to DVZ, DHL airline European Air Transport (EAT) and ASL Aviation Group are now reported to be operating pan-European flights on a scheduled basis for Amazon.\n\nThe Leipzig/Halle Airport-based EAT is flying exclusively during the day for Amazon with its Boeing 757 freighters serving East Midlands (U.K.), Paris and Madrid, with the aircraft returning to duty on behalf of DHL Express for overnight intra-European operations.\n\nMeanwhile, the Cargoforwarder.eu website reported that since mid-April of this year, two Boeing 737 freighters are operating daily flights from Cologne-Bonn to Italy and Spain on behalf of Amazon, with ASL Aviation thought to be the supplier of the planes.\n\nIt\'s almost as though DHL is following the old saying, "if you can\'t beat them, join them." Consider that Amazon just recently broke ground for its new air hub at the Cincinnati/ Northern Kentucky International Airport (CVG), which also just happens to be home to DHL\'s Americas operations. Prior to the groundbreaking, Amazon had been using DHL\'s facility at CVG to provide its services and it will likely continue until their hub is completed in 2021. DHL\'s daytime workers focus mainly on sorting materials and servicing aircraft for Amazon\'s 14 routes from the airport, while its night operations are focused on its other core international customers.\n\n**" Amazon\'s Prime Air hub promises to revolutionize the fulfillment industry worldwide."**\n\n- Kentucky Governor Matt Bevin\n\nAs Amazon continues to build both its U.S. and European air operations, what better way to combine the two operations via across the Atlantic Ocean by DHL Express, connecting CVG with Leipzig? Who\'s to say it isn\'t being done already, but if not, it seems very convenient for Amazon to utilize its existing partner at CVG and intra-European air partner for such services.\n\nImage sourced from Pixabay\n\n**General Motors Corp**. (NYSE:GM), looking to build on the growth in demand for its vehicle trunks to serve as delivery nodes, is exploring expansion opportunities with carriers and retailers outside of its current 13-month relationship with e-tailer **Amazon.com, Inc**. (NASDAQ:AMZN), a GM executive said in a May 21 interview.\n\nSpeaking with FreightWaves, Stephen London, GM\'s head of connected vehicle solutions, said the automaker is looking to bring other delivery companies into its network, as well as retailers that want to offer their customers the same level of convenience that Amazon provides members of its "Prime" service. London did not provide details of discussions with either prospective stakeholder group.\n\nIn April 2018, GM announced that more than 7 million vehicles in the U.S. that were built after 2015 would be eligible for so-called in-car delivery in conjunction with an Amazon unit that today is known as "Key by Amazon In-Car Delivery." Prime members who also owned eligible Chevrolet, Buick, GMC and Cadillac vehicles could receive deliveries at various locations as long as they were parked in publicly accessible areas such as a residence, an office parking lot or a street in front of an apartment building. The service, which is free to Prime members, is activated at order checkout on Amazon\'s website.\n\nThe program began in 37 U.S. markets. It is now available in 50 markets. In addition, virtually all GM vehicles rolling off assembly lines today are equipped with capabilities to enable in-car deliveries, London said. GM manufactured about 8.9 million vehicles in 2018, according to company data.\n\nThe service is only available in the U.S., although GM is exploring expansion it into international markets, London said.\n\nInitially, the program was designed to provide added value to GM customers while curbing incidents of "porch piracy" - incidents of theft in which packages delivered by Amazon left outside on a customer\'s property only to be pilfered. London declined comment on whether the program has reduced parcel theft, referring that question to Amazon, which also declined comment. Neither company would quantify the parcel traffic delivered to vehicles.\n\nAs the initiative evolved, GM officials noticed two trends that it did not consider at the outset, according to London. One was that customers giving a surprise gift to their spouses valued the service as a way to hide the gift in a secure yet hidden space. The other was the reduction in incidents of dogs barking at a delivery person at the front door because the package was instead placed in a location far enough away to not alert the canines, he said.\n\nRecently, GM rival **Ford Motor Co.** (NYSE:F) signed up with Amazon for a similar delivery service. In addition, Amazon has launched a program to deliver parcels into the garages of Prime customers.\n\nImage sourced from Pixabay'
 'One of our favorite images we\'ve used when pitching technology in agriculture is monitors mounted in combines as farmers till and harvest showing board futures prices and basis prices at local elevators. Well, 2019 farmers are taking it to a whole new level.\n\n****\n\nThe Journal ran an article about how expanded cell service and GPS guided tractors significantly reduce human interaction time on farm machinery, and many farmers now have a screen dedicated to **Netflix Inc  **(NASDAQ:NFLX) when they get bored on the phone negotiating crop and input prices, looking at weather forecasts, reading news, and whatever else they fill 12 to 18 hours sitting in their tractor or combine.\n\nTechnology, automation, robots, and drones have long been lauded as job killers that will cause mass unemployment in the U.S. and around the globe. But the agricultural industry in the U.S. is facing major issues that drones, AI, and all the other tech buzzwords you hear every day could truly solve. One of the top issues is there is a major shortage of workers in the agricultural space. Stricter imigration policy and low unemployment rates pressured farms in recent years, particularly in heavy labor sectors like fruit and vegetables. With farm incomes at multi-decade lows and farm debt at multi-decade highs, offering higher farm wages just isn\'t an option for many.\n\nThis lack of labor creates a new opportunity for firms to create viable solutions to alleviate these pressures. Today, we are looking at a few companies doing exciting things in the agricultural drone and robot space.\n\n****\n\n### Robo Pickers\n\nEngineers in Washington state have rolled out a robot they claim efficiently identifies, picks, and packs ripe apples. Washington is the largest producer of apples in the country, and recent laws increasing the state\'s minimum wage added costs to producers. It should have also attracted more farm workers, but with low unemployment farms are still unable to find the help they need.\n\nHow tech works: the robot operates by moving down rows of orchards and utilizes LIDAR (light detection and Ranging) along with artificial intelligence to seek optimally ripe apples. Upon detection, a robotic vacuum arm extends and carefully sucks the apple from the tree into a bin for storage.\n\nEngineers in Florida are working on a similar robot for strawberries. CROO Robotics has developed a prototype machine that is roughly the size of a bus with the length to cover a dozen rows of strawberries at once. Complex computers sit atop the machine and beneath there are HD cameras with robotic claws that are poised to pick ripe strawberries. Each robot arm can pick up to 50% of the ripe berries,  a good bit below human processing at 60% to 90%.\n\n  \nStrawberries require a special, gentle handling as to not damage the berry and require a unique ability to distinguish quality and ripeness, so while berry farmers would love to be able to automate the picking process, technology available thus far has proven less than suitable to their needs. The "AI" in these machines will need significant improvement before rolling out to commercial scale.\n\n### Robo Weeders\n\nSuperweeds such as ryegrass and palmer amaranth are actively adapting to herbicides and chemicals that have been used by farmers for decades. With ever adapting weeds that take up light, water, and nutrients, and high prices for newer, patented herbicides, farmers are always looking for new technologies to reduce costs and increase efficiency.\n\n  \nA company called FarmWise is devising yet another way to combat weeds by using cameras mounted on a robot, and using mapping directly destroy weeds by pulling them out of the ground without trampling or destroying valuable crops. This technology is very different from precision or targeted sprayers using similar identifying techniques and administering a small amount of herbicide as it can be used on organic farms.\n\nBut the technology used in these machines to identify weeds is in its infancy. The machine is only able to identify weeds in between the rows, so any weeds growing with the actual crop, in-row, it cannot differentiate. Many firms are working on AI to be able to identify which plants are crops and which are weeds, but few are in commercialization phase. And that technology would have to be adopted for vastly different types of plants.\n\n### Zapping Weeds\n\nA UK Startup, Rootwave, is using a slightly different method to kill weeds: a jolt of electricity to destroy weeds by boiling them inside out from the root up. Rootwave recently rolled out an at-home hand-weeding product, Rootwave Pro, designed for home gardeners and groundskeepers in the lawn care industry. After the Rootwave Pro, the company plans on moving focus to large-scale agriculture with its first launch in 2020. Rootwave\'s large scale robots use vision recognition to identify weeds in real-time and then deliver a 5,000 volt jolt of electricity to eliminate the target on site without damage to neighboring plants around them.\n\n  \nHow will the price of Rootwave\'s large scale farming machines compare to the on-going cost of herbicides? Little is known about repair or maintenance costs for future Rootwave robots and it is possible that the cons for purchasing and upkeep of these robots outweigh the benefits of switching over from herbicides or manual weeding. According to CEO, Andrew Diprose, the technology is comparable in cost to herbicides and long term can be more cost-effective than current herbicides on the market due to the machines lifespan.\n\n### Corporate Giants Vying for Most-Black-Mirror-Esque Patent\n\nIn April, the internet went berserk after a video made the rounds of an **Amazon.com, Inc**. (NASDAQ:AMZN) mothership drone hovering over a city releasing mini-drones for either package delivery or destruction of humans. The video turned out to be a hoax, but it felt so believable. Especially since Amazon was actually granted a patent in 2016 with a similar design.\n\n \n\nNot to be outdone dreaming up a post-apocalyptic sci-fi world, **Walmart Inc  **(NYSE:WMT) recently applied for a number of patents using drones to automate farming, including "systems and methods for pollinating crops via unmanned vehicles" \\- a robot bee.\n\n### Blockchainia!\n\nWhat would a technology special be without blockchain! And after exhaustive research we now we know exactly how much the Global Agriculture Blockchain Market will grow through 2025: 41.22%. \n\nHow they got the starting or ending numbers is a mystery, but with a number that precise it has to be true.\n\nImage sourced from Pixabay\n\nWhat do you get when you curate a conversation between two teenage tech whizzes and a 30-year veteran of the supply chain industry?\n\nA snapshot of the supply chain profession past and present. And a glimpse of the new tech talent that will continue to reshape an industry undergoing radical change.\n\n"Your mix of supply chain knowledge with technical [expertise] is going to make you both wildly successful," said Kevin O\'Meara, vice president, integrated supply chain for Shaw Industries, a leading manufacturer of flooring products. "The days of being like me where you\'re all about supply chain - those days are gone."\n\nO\'Meara participated in a telephone conversation with eighth grade students Jonathan Lei, of Acton, Massachusetts, and Harry Wang, of Carlisle, Massachusetts.\n\nWang and Lei were among over 400 finalists at the 2018 National Invention Convention and Entrepreneurship Expo, held at the Henry Ford Museum of Innovation in Dearborn, Michigan.\n\nTheir invention, named Robo Postal, comprises an automated delivery system that addresses the problem with short-term delivery - "It\'s extremely expensive because of the hub and spoke system," Lei explained.\n\nRobo Postal finds the fastest route from its current location to a specified destination by using an onboard GPS and a compass. It then navigates the grid with the shortest route calculated.\n\n**The Conversation**\n\nO\'Meara asked Lei and Wang about potential applications for the technology. Do they envision deploying Robo Postal from a truck, or would the technology be used to deliver packages from a warehouse to the final destination?\n\n"We were thinking about it as point-to-point rather than standard delivery," said Lei. A user would summon the robot via app - "like Uber Eats for package delivery," he said.\n\nO\'Meara applauded that idea but also suggested the inventors broaden their thinking by considering the delivery concept known as "stem and petal," in which a driver pulls up to a central location - the stem - then "petals" out the final deliveries located in a single high-density area.\n\n"Imagine if I\'m the driver," O\'Meara explained. "Rather than making 20 deliveries, I just shoot them out and they make all the deliveries."\n\nO\'Meara and the teens engaged in some back and forth about drones. Lei and Wang researched aerial technology but didn\'t think drones would function efficiently in an urban environment. O\'Meara agreed but suggested that rural areas might benefit from a combination of drones and Robo Postal.\n\n"You have this incredible technology," he said. "Now let your mind wander in terms of all the ways it could be utilized."\n\nOn April 27, Lei and Wang were featured on the CW\'s "Did I Mention Invention" television program. The digital natives said they have been interested in computer programming and video games since they were in elementary school, and that they perfected the technology while attending a computer science academy called KTByte.\n\nO\'Meara\'s background, by contrast, is steeped in traditional supply chain and logistics practice. He joined the military out of college, where he "got a feeling for how supply chain works," and has held numerous executive positions with major brands including Schneider and Whirlpool.\n\n**Old and new**\n\nHe gave the kids a brief history of the supply chain industry. **Walmart Inc  **(NYSE:WMT), he explained, invented the idea that a supply chain can be a competitive advantage.\n\n"They built out an incredible supply chain and no one could touch it." **DellInc** (NYSE:DELL) was another early adopter known for moving its products quickly - "a recipe for massive profitability even though Dell didn\'t make any computer that was different than any other computer."\n\nO\'Meara also said, "Then of course **Amazon.com, Inc.  **(NASDAQ:AMZN) came along, and Amazon is far more a supply chain company than it is a retailer, marketer or merchandiser."\n\n"Supply chain," he concluded, "has moved from a back office necessary evil to the front office. It is the core of what companies do today."\n\n**The disruptors**\n\nBut that core now revolves around technology innovation, a shift that Lei and Wang are well-positioned to benefit from.\n\n"What\'s interesting is the more you learn, the more you are inspired," said Lei, who recently enrolled in artificial intelligence classes.\n\nWhat else is on their agenda? Lei already has his own website hosting service with around 60 customers and 190 orders from 20 countries. His goal is to become an entrepreneur.\n\nWang said he is thinking about going into the technology field. "I just find it interesting," he said.\n\nRobo Postal is right in line with the evolution of the industry, O\'Meara said. "In fact you are further ahead than some. There is no doubt my industry is in good hands."\n\nImage sourced from Pixabay\n\n**Target Corporation**(NYSE:TGT) has shown strong sales growth and is getting no respect from investors, according to JPMorgan.\n\n### The Analyst\n\nChristopher Horvers upgraded Target from Neutral to Overweight and raised the price target from $81 to $100. \n\n### The Thesis\n\nTarget\'s shares are undervalued and have been placed in the "lower end of the \'middle bucket\' of retail, Horvers said -- adding that he believes the company should be valued closer to the top of the group. (See his track record here.) \n\nTarget has reported strong comparable sales and now has expanding operating income after three years of declines, the analyst said. But what tips the scales for JPMorgan are recent share gains in home and apparel, he said. Both categories were up in the first quarter and well above the growth rates of competitors in those aisles. \n\nTarget\'s overall comps were some of the best in the first quarter in large-cap retail, the analyst said. \n\n"As we\'ve been saying since last fall, we prefer share gainers in light of our constrained view of the consumer in 2019," Horvers said.\n\n"The inflection in margin is real with the GM dilution per unit of ecommerce growth improving and cost control remains strong, which biases margins and valuation to the upside."\n\nOn the subject of share price, the analyst said Target gets no respect.\n\n"TGT is priced like the Rodney Dangerfield of large cap retail despite a robust dividend yield." \n\nTarget doesn\'t need to outrun **Amazon.com Inc**. (NASDAQ:AMZN), in JPMorgan\'s view; it needs to outrun mall- and off-mall-based and structurally impaired peers, Horvers said. \n\n### Price Action\n\nTarget shares were up 1.6 percent at $78.80 at the time of publication Thursday. \n\n_Related Links_\n\n_Target\'s Strong Q1, Guidance Send Shares Higher_\n\n_Morgan Stanley Upgrades Target After Recent Pullback_\n\n_Photo byExcel23/Wikimedia. _\n\nAfter 26 years, billionaire hedge fund manager David Tepper is shutting down his Appaloosa LP to outside investors.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal has reported Tepper plans to return outside clients\' money as the 61-year-old Tepper plans to spend more time on the Carolina Panthers, the NFL team for which he serves as principal owner.\n\nAppaloosa has $13 billion in assets, and people familiar with the matter said executives are still discussing a timeframe and procedure for returning clients\' money. Moving forward, Appaloosa will serve as a family office, devoted strictly to managing Tepper\'s personal wealth, which is estimated at around $11.6 billion. Tepper\'s personal investments make up about 70 percent of Appaloosa\'s assets under management.\n\n### Tepper\'s Success\n\nTepper founded Appaloosa back in 1993 after he was unable to gain a partnership at **Goldman Sachs Group Inc.** (NYSE:GS). Appaloosa has reportedly generated an average annual return of more than 25 percent ever since. Tepper famously made roughly a $7 billion profit for Appaloosa investors in 2009 by buying shares of distressed bank stocks near their financial crisis lows, including **Bank of America Corp** (NYSE:BAC) at around $3 per share. Today, Bank of America stock trades at around $27.75.\n\nLast year, Tepper made headlines by acquiring the Carolina Panthers for a record $2.2 billion.

Left claims Jumia inflated its numbers to pump up its IPO valuation after it couldn\'t raise money from its top investors in Africa.\n\nCitron claims Jumia reported 2.1 million active customers and 43,000 active merchants for 2017 in its 2018 investor presentation, but it reported 2.7 million customers and 53.000 merchants to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Left also alleges that Jumia did not tell U.S. investors that 41 percent of its total 2018 orders were returned.\n\nOn Tuesday, Left added Jumia allegedly has an undisclosed key performance indicator suggesting more than half of the company\'s total orders in Nigeria, its largest market, are "invalid or fraud."\n\n### Price Target $0\n\nFollowing the release of the new report, Left tweeted that things are so bad at Jumia that the stock is a candidate for a regulatory halt and/or delisting.\n\n"Former executive testimonies with documented proof of manipulated financials and FAKE ORDERS Auditors must resign and restatements will take Jumia to $0," he wrote.\n\nJumia shares initially traded lower by 4.6 percent on Tuesday and are down 32 percent since Citron\'s initial fraud accusations.\n\nThe stock traded around $23.41 per share at time of publication Tuesday afternoon.\n\n_Related Links:_\n\n_Citron Research Calls Jumia An\'Obvious Fraud\' _\n\n_6 Months After Turning Bullish, Citron\'s Andrew Left Is Out Of Tesla_\n\n_Photo credit:Max19871010, Wikimedia_\n\nGood day,\n\nEurope has a long-held reputation for being ahead of the curve when it comes to green transportation. However, a recent study supported by the European Union\'s COLHD project found that it is not the case in transitioning from diesel to alternative fuels (AF) to power heavy-duty trucks. "Our research shows there is no common European support strategy towards AFs, and a clear lack of political and financial support, together with the discontinuity of policies and low economic appeal of alternative fuel solutions." The study also pointed to the limited number of refilling stations along European road networks, mainly due to the insufficient availability of brands and models of alternative-fueled vehicles (AFVs) in the market.\n\n### Did You Know?:\n\nThe global intermodal freight transportation market will grow at a 7 percent compounded annual rate through 2026, according to Global Market Research\n\n### Quotable:\n\n> "This battle between **UPS  **(NYSE:UPS), **Amazon.com, Inc.**(NASDAQ:AMZN) and USPS is extremely complicated, political and financial, impacts a tremendous number of people, and is far from over."\n> \n> - John Haber, CEO of consultancy Spend Management Experts, referring to the U.S. Supreme Court\'s decision to deny UPS\' appeal of a lower court ruling that upheld the U.S. Postal Service\'s controversial cost accounting structure.

What may be lost in the discussion, though, is Amazon\'s ability to erect delivery nodes seemingly everywhere, and out of nowhere. Walmart may have the brick-and-mortar advantage, but Amazon still holds the cards with its technology and its ubiquitousness. One should never say never, but if **Walmart Inc  **(NYSE:WMT) can\'t stop the Bezos bulldozer, it\'s hard to think of any U.S. company that can.\n\nHammer down, everyone!\n\nImage sourced from Pixabay\n\nWorldwide shipments of "connected" vehicles - cars and light trucks with wireless cellular connectivity that interfaces with the vehicle data - will reach 51.1 million units during 2019, a 45.4 percent increase over 2018 levels, the research firm International Data Corp. (IDC) said Thursday.\n\nThe well-known market intelligence firm, in its first-ever report on the segment, said that 76.3 million units will be shipped worldwide by 2023, a 16.8 percent compounded annual growth rate over a five-year period that began last year.\n\nBy 2023, 70 percent of all vehicles worldwide will be shipped with factory-installed or "embedded" connectivity, IDC said. In the U.S., 90 percent of all vehicles will be shipped with built-in capabilities. For example, virtually all new **General Motors** vehicles (NYSE:GM) are being manufactured with connectivity capabilities installed at the factory. Both GM and rival **Ford Motor Co**. (NYSE:F) are using connectivity for, among other things, offering in-car delivery services to customers of **Amazon.com. Inc.** \'s (NASDAQ:AMZN) Prime service.\n\nOlder vehicles that don\'t have factory-installed systems can still connect with an aftermarket device which is a self-contained unit installed in a vehicle\'s port.\n\nThe growth of the connected vehicles market is being fueled by the ability of automakers to utilize the technology for cost avoidance and revenue generation, the effect of evolving government regulations and consumers\' desire for a "more immersive vehicle experience," the report said.\n\n"The automotive ecosystem is positioning the vehicle as the next emerging digital platform," said Matt Arcaro, IDC\'s research manager, next-generation automotive research.

Hibbett shares closed at $23.96 on Friday.\n\n\n\n \n\nAfter a long holiday weekend watching auto racing, hosting and attending barbecues, and enjoying the late spring weather, investors regroup today to a stock market that\'s played defense for weeks and feels exhausted as summer begins.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average (TSX:DJI) fell last week for the fifth week in a row, its longest losing streak since 2011. Though the S&P 500 Index (SPX) did bounce off of recent lows, it remains down around 4% from all-time highs posted in late April. A mixed tone prevails in the early going Tuesday, with direction a little hard to find as news looks thin. A full data calendar this short week could help lend some direction as the days pass.\n\nOverseas events--mainly China and Brexit--arguably represent a stiff headwind for Wall Street, with British Prime Minister Theresa May\'s resignation announcement only the most recent gust as a pro-Brexit party made election gains in Britain.\n\nMay\'s departure could raise chances of a "no-deal" Brexit, some media outlets report, and no one is really sure what that might look like. If there\'s one thing the markets don\'t relish, it\'s uncertainty, which could help explain the cautious trading that\'s taken hold. \n\nOn the China front, President Trump wrapped up a visit to Japan Tuesday saying he\'s not ready to make a deal with Beijing, but thinks one eventually will come together. Until there\'s more signs of progress there, it\'s hard to imagine a major recovery for stocks. With European elections and trade talks with Japan also in the mix, many investors seem to have a "risk-off" mentality at the moment.\n\nOne sign of possible caution is strength in the Treasury market. U.S. 10-year Treasury yields fell below 2.3% to one-and-a-half-year lows early Tuesday. Treasuries have really caught a bid here this morning, rising rapidly and pushing yields back toward last week\'s low mark. \n\nYields move the opposite of the underlying product, so the recent yield collapse likely signals more investors pumping money into where they apparently see safety, the U.S. Treasury. The dollar--often seen as another defensive asset--has also been strong lately, though it fell Friday. Risk-off trading might reflect investor concerns as U.S. business investment slows (see more below) and some retailers warn of supply-chain issues related to the trade battle with China. \n\n### Shoes for Christmas?\n\nSpeaking of supply chains and China, things you might not have even thought of start to factor into this, like Christmas lights. Almost 95% of them are manufactured in China, the Conference Board President and CEO noted late last week. It\'s a small thing, but it adds up to a lot of dollars when you consider how many Christmas trees go up every December and the chance of consumers having to dip deeper into their pockets or go without.\n\nThen we have companies like shoe seller **Foot Locker, Inc.** (NYSE:FL), whose shares fell nearly 16% Friday and lost all of their 2019 gains after FL missed Wall Street\'s earnings expectations. The company cut its full-year guidance amid worries about how tariffs could affect its sales. FL was one of the companies signing a letter to the Trump administration last week warning how tariffs could hurt their businesses.\n\nMaybe an interesting homework project for investors would be to start researching which companies have done a better job inoculating themselves against potential tariff impacts. While no company is necessarily a perfect example, Adidas AG, whose stock trades in Europe, switched its suppliers to Indonesia and Vietnam a while back, making a concerted effort to get out of China. Some economists say other companies that may be somewhat less exposed to the tariff war include **Amazon.com, Inc.**  (NASDAQ:AMZN), **Target Corporation** (NYSE:TGT), and **Macy \'s Inc** (NYSE:M). \n\nOne way to research the company impact is to go back to Q1 earnings call transcripts or listen to earnings calls coming up next quarter to get a sense of the exposure various companies face. If you have the time, consider reading about the risks companies face in their recent reports to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which companies have to include in regular filings. \n\nThe other question to think about researching, besides sourcing, is whether companies that do source from China have the brand power to raise prices and pass some of the added costs on to the consumer without losing business. Those that can\'t could start to see their margins pressed.\n\n### Price Check\n\nIt\'s harder to determine whether China woes might have be priced into some companies\' shares after weeks of turmoil. One example could be **Ralph Lauren Corp**  (NYSE:RL), which has had a rough go of it lately in the stock market due in part to its China exposure. However, one analyst argued last week that the bad news is priced into the stock. It\'s an individual story with each stock, so investors should consider doing the footwork if they own shares of specific companies and trying to get a sense of where things might stand.\n\nFrom a technical standpoint, the old week ended with the SPX in relatively decent shape. That\'s because it didn\'t fall below what some analysts see as technical support near the 2800 level. The SPX tested that area twice this month and bounced off each time, possibly a sign of resilience. That doesn\'t mean, however, that we can necessarily expect a quick re-test of the highs. That seems unlikely unless the trade picture suddenly improves, but both sides seem to be digging in their heels.\n\nThere\'s a lot of data packed into this short week (see more below), but arguably nothing stands out more than the government\'s second estimate of Q1 gross domestic product (GDP), due early Thursday. Last time out, we got a bullish surprise growth number of 3.2%, and analysts look for 3.1% in the second estimate, according to a Briefing.com consensus.. This comes as estimates for Q2 GDP continue to sink, with JP Morgan making headlines Friday with its forecast for just 1% GDP growth in Q2. The Atlanta Fed\'s forecast isn\'t much higher at 1.3%.\n\nEarnings season has faded to a whimper, but there\'s a  scattering of reports arguably worth a look this week, including **Costco Wholesale Corporation**  (NASDAQ:COST), **Gap Inc**  (NYSE:GPS), and **Uber Technologies Inc** (NYSE:UBER). For UBER, it\'s the first earnings report since going public, and the company has already forecast a big quarterly loss. The stock is trading a little below its initial public offering (IPO) level.\n\nCrude is another important factor to consider watching this week after U.S. prices fell to two-month lows below $60 a barrel over the last two trading sessions. Early Tuesday, crude rallied again and now is flirting with the $60 level. U.S. crude stockpiles have been on the rise, but gasoline stocks remain below their historic averages. That might be one reason why gas prices are up more than 60 cents a gallon since the start of the year and reached a new peak recently even with crude prices down about $10 from their spring highs. \n\nIt wouldn\'t be too surprising to see gas start to drop from this point as stockpiles have grown recently and the big holiday driving weekend is now in the rear-view mirror. On the other hand, some analysts think gas prices could rise even more as refiners switch to more expensive summer blends.  \n   \n**Figure 1:  SOMETHING TO CHEW ON:** Corn futures (candlestick) head into the summer growing season on a real tear, up sharply over the last two weeks as many farmers eye their flooded fields and switch to soybeans (purple line) instead. The anticipated additional soybean acres, along with lack of demand from China, have soybean futures looking flat over the same time period. Data Source: CME.

Past performance does not guarantee future results._  \n\n**Consumers, Start Your Engines** : A lot of data are packed in a small package this shortened week, starting with consumer confidence for May later this morning. That could be an interesting one to watch, because it captures sentiment from after the China trade talks went south and stocks started to flag. Last time out, for April, confidence surged along with the market as stocks neared record highs. The 129.2 headline reading in April was up several points from March, with consumers especially optimistic about the near-term outlook. We\'ll see if that sagged at all in May, as the consensus view reported by Briefing.com stands at 130. The other consumer metrics to potentially keep an eye on this week are personal spending and income on Friday along with University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment the same day. Basically, investors are likely to exit the week (and the month) with a much better idea of how consumers feel about the economy, especially after a mixed outcome from the recent retail earnings season.\n\n**Businesses Downshift Spending** : Looking back at data from the end of last week, it was a bit concerning to see capital investment from businesses continue to look soft in core capital goods orders for April. That reading, which doesn\'t include defense or aircraft spending, was down 0.9% from the previous month, and capital goods spending growth just had its worst 12-month period of the Trump administration with a rise of just a little over 1% (that compares to double-digit yearly growth readings a couple of years ago). Total durable orders fell 2.1% in April, but that partly reflected **Boeing Co \'s** (NYSE:BA) issues with its 737 MAX. \n\nMany economists have already noted softness in business spending this year, which could indicate lack of economic confidence among decision makers at some of the country\'s biggest companies. Recent pullbacks in guidance for the remainder of the year, which we saw during the earnings season, add to a sense that businesses aren\'t going into the second half of 2019 feeling all that optimistic about where growth might go from here. This also could end up weighing on merger and acquisition (M&A) activity if it continues, because arguably businesses won\'t necessarily want to expand in an uncertain environment with Brexit and China trade issues still dominating discussion. We\'ll have to wait and see.\n\n**Soggy Silos and Inflation** : Corn prices exploded recently due in part to flooding in the Midwest, and that could play into inflation readings in coming months. Remember, corn isn\'t just about the corn on the cob you and your family might have munched over the holiday weekend. It\'s mainly used as an animal feed, and when it gets more expensive it sometimes leads to higher meat prices. That could be something to track. Besides the flooding, which according to some reports left many silos of stored grain unusable due to wetness at the bottom of the silos where the grain was housed, the China trade situation also plays into the corn market (as it seems to with just about everything). There\'s talk that farmers might plant more soybeans this year, not just due to flooding but also because the government is reimbursing soybean farmers for lost exports of the commodity to China. Soybean exports are down dramatically the last year or two. When more soybeans get planted, that typically eats into corn acreage.\n\nAnyway, the place to look for any possible food price impact will be in coming inflation data. The Fed\'s favored reading, the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) prices report for April, is due this Friday.\n\n_Information from TDA is not intended to be investment advice or construed as a recommendation or endorsement of any particular investment or investment strategy, and is for illustrative purposes only.

 'Mark Yusko, CEO and Chief Investment Officer of Morgan Creek Capital Management, joined Benzinga\'s PreMarket Prep trading show on Wednesday morning. Yusko discussed the recent rally in bitcoin, which has sent the **Grayscale Bitcoin Trust** (OTC:GBTC) up 10.5 percent in the past two weeks.\n\n"Bitcoin is a really interesting thing. You mention that there\'s no underlying value, and there actually is. It\'s a network, it\'s actually quite easy to value using Metcalfe\'s Law," Yusko said on the show.\n\n### Bitcoin As A Network\n\nMetcalfe\'s Law is a formula used to calculate the value of computer and telecommunications networks that states that a network\'s value is proportional to the square of its users.\n\n"There was a time back in 2017 when the price got much higher than the inherent value of the network, and we told our friends and clients and everyone that would listen that at $20,000 it probably had at least 50 percent downside," Yusko said.\n\nYusko said traders often get caught up in the price of an asset and lose sight of the value.\n\n"Price is a liar. The price of anything is just what two people will exchange that good or service for, but it really doesn\'t have any information content on the underlying value," Yusko said. "We\'ll make the argument that the reason bitcoin prices are rising today is that for the last year in the brice bear market, there was a massive bull market in fundamentals."\n\n### Bitcoin Fundamental Value\n\nYusko said record numbers of bitcoin wallets and transactions and an increasing adoption rate are all fundamental signs that the value of bitcoin is growing. Yusko said **Amazon.com, Inc.** (NASDAQ:AMZN) is a perfect example of a valuable network.\n\n"It\'s not a real company in the sense of what do they actually do? They don\'t manufacture products. They don\'t actually do anything other than be a search engine and connect buyers and sellers, but they are a network. The more people that use it, the more valuable that network is."\n\nUsing Metcalfe\'s Law as a basis, Yusko currently assigns a $12,000 to $13,000 fundamental value to bitcoin, suggesting roughly 37 percent upside from the cryptocurrency\'s current price. He said calculating bitcoin\'s value is an inexact science in that it involves assumptions about growth and usage.\n\nAfter a disastrous 2018 for bitcoin investors, the GBTC fund is now up 193.6 percent in 2019.\n\nBitcoin traded around $8,724 at time of publication.\n\n_Related Links:_\n\n_Bitcoin Gets\'60 Minutes\' Bump _\n\n_Here\'s What Happened Last Time Bitcoin Approached $10,000_\n\n**Charlotte \'s Web Holdings, Inc.** (OTC:CWBHF) followed up its first-quarter report with an announcement Wednesday thatit will begin trading on the Toronto Stock Exchange May 31.\n\nThis makes Charlotte\'s Web the first U.S.-based hemp company with a senior listing on the Toronto Stock Exchange, according to the company. \n\n### The Q1 Print\n\nCharlotte\'s Web posted an adjusted first-quarter EBITDA of $4.5 million; net income of $2.3 million; and earnings per share of 3 cents per share, or 2 cents when diluted.\n\nThe hemp extract company\'s organic consolidated revenue grew 66-percent year-over-year to $21.7 million. \n\nHighlights included an expansion of executive leadership with the addition of a CEO, COO and CGO; the shipment of the company\'s first orders to food and drug retailers; the launch of a new pet line; the kickoff of digital advertising and e-commerce pilot programs with **Alphabet Inc**(NASDAQ:GOOGL) (NASDAQ:GOOG) and **Amazon.com, Inc.** (NASDAQ:AMZN); and the planting of more hemp for a total of more than 700 acres. \n\n### The TSX Listing \n\nCommon Charlotte\'s Web shares will trade on the TSX under its symbol CWEB.\n\nCharlotte\'s Web common shares will be delisted voluntarily from the Canadian Securities Exchange, the company said. \n\nThe move to the TSX comes only nine months after the company\'s Aug. 30, 2018 IPO.\n\nChairman and Co-Founder Joel Stanley said the listing is a "tremendous validator" of the company\'s corporate governance and evolution. \n\n"Moreover, it represents a milestone for the overall industry from a legal and regulatory perspective. We are grateful for the support that we have received from the Canadian capital markets and equally grateful to our hardworking team in Colorado and across the country."\n\n_Related links:_\n\n_Charlotte\'s Web Names Former Kellogg Executive As CEO_\n\n_5 Cannabis And CBD Stocks That Aren\'t Blowing Smoke_'
 'When we think about investing in the technology space, we often think of the **Apple Inc \'s** (NASDAQ:AAPL), **Facebook Inc \'s** (NASDAQ:FB) and **Twitter Inc \'s** (NYSE:TWTR) of the world. However, looking at all of these stocks over the past year shows that they\'ve either lost money or traded with modest gains.\n\n  \nObviously, when investing, our goal is to get the biggest bang for our buck, and declines or modest gains simply don\'t fit that bill. Nonetheless, there are some gems in technology that have seen strong movement over the past year and are likely to continue on an upbeat trend. Here are hot stocks to keep an eye on in the space.\n\n  \n**Amazon.com, Inc.  (NASDAQ:AMZN): 13.86% Price Growth In The Past 12 Months**  \nAmazon is a massive company that\'s likely only getting bigger. Over the past year, the stock has climbed 13.86% as early investments in infrastructure and an evolving retail market take center stage.\n\n  \nAmazon is second to none as the world\'s leader in online retail, also known as eCommerce. While many bashed the company\'s heavy spending early on and focus on high volume sales with small margins, no one is looking down on the company these days.\n\n  \nIn fact, according to Tipranks, 34 analysts currently weigh in on the company with all 34 of them recommending that investors buy the stock. Moreover, the average price target on the stock represents a more than 20% potential upside.\n\n  \nSo, what\'s driving the positive opinions? There are a few factors to consider here. First and foremost, while eCommerce is gaining in popularity, it still only accounted for about 14.3% of retail sales in the United States in 2018. That leaves plenty of room for further growth ahead.\n\n  \nMoreover, Amazon.com is a clear beneficiary of the 15% annual increase in eCommerce sales. In fact, Amazon.com accounted for more than 40% of all eCommerce sales in the United States in 2018. Ultimately, the company\'s stronghold on the market doesn\'t look to be changing anytime soon, and, as the market grows, the fruits of the company\'s labor only grow with it.\n\n  \nIt\'s also worth mentioning that although analysts are bullish with strong positive opinions, the company consistently outpaces analyst expectations. In fact, the company has generated a positive earnings surprise across the last seven consecutive quarters.\n\n  \nWith a growing market that is creating strong opportunities, a leadership position that doesn\'t seem to be going away anytime soon, and strong analyst opinions matched with consistently positive earnings results, it\'s hard to argue against Amazon as a strong investment option.\n\n  \n**Zendesk (NYSE:ZEN): 57.23% Price Growth Over The Past 12 Months**  \nNext on the list, we have Zendesk, a customer service platform company with strong growth that\'s likely to continue in the right direction. When I say strong growth, I\'m not just talking about price appreciation. The company is growing by many other measures.\n\n  \nFor example, the company reported its financial results for the fourth quarter of 2018 in February, showing that sales grew by 41% year over year. The company also generated $0.10 per share, beating analyst expectations of $0.03 per share by a large margin.\n\n  \nIn May, the company released yet another strong earnings report, showing that the growth isn\'t slowing by any means. In fact, in the first quarter, sales climbed 40% year over year with earnings climbing 100% year over year.\n\n  \nMuch of the growth that we\'re seeing out of Zendesk comes from its product known as the Zendesk Suite. This is a product suite that allows businesses to connect between colleagues and with customers through various different channels.\n\n  \nThe company\'s leadership position within its niche is only growing stronger. In fact, there are currently 145,600 paying customers on the platform at the moment, an increase of more than 16% year over year.\n\n  \nWhile we have seen strong growth as of late, this isn\'t likely to come to an end anytime soon. In fact, many argue that it is in full growth mode right now as it continues to tap into an expanding market of cloud-based customer service tools.\n\n  \nWith continued innovation and a proven model that is leading to incredible growth, Zendesk is a stock that anyone interested in tech should be paying attention to right now.\n\n  \n**Galaxy Next Generation: 56.35% Price Growth Over The Past 12 Months**  \nGalaxy Next Generation is a company that is on the leading edge of the technological evolution that we\'re currently seeing in the classroom. With today\'s children finding it easier to focus on screens than on a chalkboard, the company is in the right place at the right time to capitalize on the change in times.\n\n  \nGalaxy Next Generation is a distributor of interactive educational technology hardware and software. The company\'s products are designed to increase engagement in between student and teacher and provide a fully collaborative instructional environment.\n\n  \nThe company\'s claim to fame is a robust line of private label interactive touch screen panels. These panels can be matched with several national and international branded peripheral and communications devices to assist teachers in bringing lessons to their students in a more engaging way.\n\n  \nWhile the stock has already grown more than 50% over the past year, we are likely just seeing the tip of the iceberg as its aggressive expansion strategy continues to pay dividends. In fact, we have seen more than 80% growth in the company\'s domestic reseller program over this period.   \nMoving forward, the company is working to not only expand in the United States, but around the world, working to take its aggressive growth to a global and highly valuable market. In fact, the smart education market is a rapidly growing one, with estimates putting the global market\'s value at around $994 billion by the year 2024.\n\n  \nInterestingly, there is little to nothing when it comes to publicly traded competition. In fact, the only direct, publicly traded competitor that Galaxy Next Generation has is Boxlight. While Boxlight trades with a higher market cap, the company is nowhere near Galaxy Next Generation when it comes to edging up on profits, and its stock is showing the pain, with losses of more than 50% over the past year.\n\n  \nAll in all, with little by way of realistic competition, a growing market, and an aggressive expansion strategy, Galaxy Next Generation is poised for further strong growth ahead.\n\n  \n**Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD): 117.29% Price Growth Over The Past 12 Months**  \nAdvanced Micro Devices, a graphics chip maker, is another hot tech stock to dig into. Just looking at the fact that the stock has more than doubled over the past year is impressive. However, there\'s a strong argument that this growth is likely to continue.\n\n  \nOne of the factors that continues to drive Advanced Micro Devices higher is the fact that innovation at the company is continuing rapidly. In fact, over the Memorial Day weekend, the company announced a new line of products ready to launch.\n\n  \nThe announcement took place at the trade show known as Computex, which took place over the holiday weekend. The new chips, known as the Ryzen 3000-series, are central processing units designed specifically to challenge **Intel Corporation  **(NASDAQ:INTC), which the company has been doing a great job of as of late. Advanced Micro Devices also highlighted new Graphics Processing Units that are likely to shake things up at **Nvidia Corporation  **(NASDAQ:NVDA), a company with a dominant role in the gaming market.\n\n  \nIt is expected that these new products will hit the market as early as July of 2019, making good on the company\'s promise to launch new products in the second half of 2019.\n\n  \nAs the company continues to innovate, launching new products that shake up high value industries like gaming, personal computers, and cloud computing, investors are expecting to see strong growth in revenue and earnings, setting the stage for price appreciation ahead.\n\n  \n**Final Thoughts**  \nWhile the technology space has been relatively mixed over the past year or so, if you dig deep enough, it\'s not uncommon to find gold. When it comes to technology stocks, those mentioned above have not only seen strong growth over the past year, but there are strong arguments that this growth will continue.\n\n**About the author:**\n\nOfir Eyal Bar, a successful businessman and Real Estate investor, has more than 15 years of experience in global financial markets as a real estate entrepreneur and investor.

Those parcels account for about 10 percent of the unit\'s volume and have been a challenge to handle efficiently because they cannot be run through its conveyor systems that are used for small parcels. FedEx said it will design facilities dedicated to larger packages and will add specialized equipment to its existing locations.\n\nThe launch of year-round Sunday deliveries - FedEx Ground operates on Sundays during the peak holiday season - and the diversion of postal deliveries into the unit\'s network are the first major service enhancements announced since Raj Subramaniam took over in January as FedEx president and COO, putting him effectively in charge of the $69 billion a year company\'s day-to-day business.\n\nThe Sunday deliveries are a response to consumers\' demands to have access to delivery services every day of the week. USPS has been delivering on Sundays for e-tailer **Amazon.com, Inc.** (NASDAQ:AMZN) since 2014. According to Ryan Kelly, a FedEx e-commerce executive, 59 percent of online shoppers and 70 percent of merchants would "definitely or probably" use Sunday deliveries, mainly for expensive and/or time-sensitive purchases. Kelly\'s comments, which cited FedEx proprietary research, were posted May 30 on the website LinkedIn. FedEx declined to comment on any of its initiatives beyond the information contained in its May 30 statement.\n\nThe FedEx Sunday service may force rival **UPS Inc.** , (NYSE:UPS) which doesn\'t deliver on Sundays, to enter the seven-day-a-week delivery game for the first time in its 112-year history. The recently ratified collective bargaining agreement with the Teamsters union, whose members deliver all UPS parcels, established a two-tier driver classification allowing the company to schedule its drivers outside of the core Monday through Friday delivery cycle. Drivers working under the new classification are paid less than the company\'s primary drivers who work Monday through Friday. However, it is doubtful that, even at the lower wage scale, UPS can lower its labor costs to match that of FedEx Ground, which uses independent delivery contractors and which may rely on part-timers for the Sunday deliveries.\n\nThe re-directing of shipments that are now tendered to USPS could be a significant blow to the quasi-governmental agency, which has relied on expanding parcel volumes to offset declines in its first-class and marketing mail business. Under the FedEx relationship with USPS, about 2 million parcels a day are currently directed to the postal infrastructure for final delivery to residences. As recently as USPS\' 2016 fiscal year, FedEx tendered 600 million pieces; FedEx has already diverted about 20 percent of that traffic.\n\nUSPS prices the service relatively cheaply because it must deliver to every U.S. address anyway. FedEx and UPS, which has a similar arrangement with USPS, benefit because they don\'t need to dispatch labor and equipment. In addition, both get additional discounts for being large-volume customers.\n\nThe service, which at USPS is known as "Parcel Select," has helped merchants and retailers keep down shipping costs, and allowed them to offer free shipping for e-commerce orders. In recent years, however, FedEx, UPS and Amazon, which account for most of USPS\' parcel business at more than 2.5 billion packages a year combined, have diverted volumes into their own networks by merging those shipments with packages destined for the same or nearby addresses. FedEx, which will accelerate the process starting this fall, plans to divert virtually all of its postal business by the end of 2020. UPS has been re-directing postal shipments for the past five years. Amazon is handling an increasing number of shipments through its own system, and it is believed that, over time, it will self-deliver in densely populated areas and use USPS for service to areas where it is less cost-effective for Amazon to dispatch its own equipment and drivers.\n\nThe re-directing trend is expected to continue as the private carriers, leveraging technological and infrastructure improvements, begin to create adequate shipment density on residential routes, something that has so far proven elusive. Satish Jindel, president of consultancy ShipMatrix, said Thursday that he expects UPS to follow FedEx\'s lead by the end of the decade. At the same time, Jindel questioned USPS\' push to expand to seven-day parcel deliveries at a time when its three main customers are effectively throttling back.\n\nUSPS, for its part, warned as far back as February 2017 that its three customers were building their own delivery alternatives and that the multi-year, mostly double-digit  growth of its shipping and package operations could be jeopardized as a result.\n\nThe challenge for FedEx will be to determine if it is cheaper to handle the parcels in-house rather than tender them to USPS. Jerry Hempstead, who runs a consultancy bearing his name and who spent decades in top posts at DHL and Airborne Express, which DHL acquired in 2003, said his experience at Airborne was that it was less costly to move parcels weighing more than 10 pounds in-house than to pay USPS to do it. Though package weights are rising as a wider range of goods are ordered online, the typical e-commerce shipments weighs in the 4 to 7 pound range.\n\nImage sourced from Pixabay']
