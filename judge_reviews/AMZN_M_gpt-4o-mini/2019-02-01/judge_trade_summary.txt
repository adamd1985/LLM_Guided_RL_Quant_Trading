['Investors seeking exposure to the cloud sector have many options, but CNBC\'s Jim Cramer said software analytics company **New Relic Inc** (NYSE:NEWR) is a "cloud prince" that provides a vital service by tracking how customers interact with businesses in real time. \n\n### What Happened\n\nOne of New Relic\'s high-profile clients is "Fortnite" maker Epic Games, New Relic CEO and founder Lew Cirne told CNBC\'s Jim Cramer Wednesday.\n\nEpic Games relies on New Relic\'s platform to "see everything in real time," which is essential for the video game maker\'s team to run the game 24/7, he said. A common misconception among investors is that New Relic is in direct competition to win clients like Epic Games against much larger cloud players like **Microsoft Corporation** (NASDAQ:MSFT) and **Amazon.com, Inc.** (NASDAQ:AMZN), Cirne said. \n\n"There are different companies that do different things in and around observing what is going on in the space" he said. "We are the application-centric company."\n\n### Why It\'s Important\n\nNew Relic is much more than just a provider of analytics that help a company maintain a consistent product, Cirne said. \n\nThe company offers the "visibility that gives [a company] confidence to move faster and scale," the executive said. The company also helps clients deliver business results to satisfy investors, he sai. \n\n"If your site is slower on Cyber Monday -- forget it, you are going to miss your quarter," he said. "You may never recover from that because you also have a brand hit."\n\n### What\'s Next\n\nNew Relic will continue targeting any company anywhere in the world that has systems which "need to perform well and scale well," Cirne told Cramer. \n\n"Those are the systems that need Relic." \n\n_Related Links:_\n\n_Constellation Brands CEO Defends Stock, Tells Cramer Sell-Off Was\'Total Overreaction\'_\n\n_Cramer Calls Goldman Sachs A Standout, Bank Of America The\'Amazon Of Bank Stocks\'_\n\n_Screenshot courtesy of Epic Games.  _\n\nStreaming service **Netflix, Inc.  **(NASDAQ:NFLX) is scheduled to report fourth-quarter earnings after the closing bell Thursday, Jan. 17. Earlier in the week, NFLX announced that it would be raising prices for U.S. subscribers by $1 to $2 depending on the plan. Investors sent shares up 6.5% on Tuesday following the announcement, as the move is projected to tack on a little over $1 billion in revenue per year based on current subscriber levels. \n\nNext quarter\'s results should reveal the business impact of the price. For the quarter at hand, NFLX is expected to report EPS of $0.24, down from $0.41 in the prior-year period, on revenue of $4.21 billion, according to third-party consensus analyst estimates. Revenue is projected to grow 28% year over year (YoY). \n\nAs has been the case in recent reports, subscriber additions, content spending and cash flow, and growing competition are likely to be some of the main areas analysts and investors hone in on. \n\n### Subscriber Additions\n\nThis is typically NFLX\'s largest quarter for subscriber additions and it has forecasted that it will add 9.4 million subscribers in the fourth quarter--1.8 million in the U.S. and 7.6 million internationally. That would bring its total subscriber count in the U.S. to 60.26 million and 86.24 million abroad. One thing to note is that NFLX\'s subscriber addition guidance will only include paid memberships starting with this quarter\'s report, whereas it previously included people that were on a free trial. \n\nWhen the company last reported, the stock climbed as much as 15% after subscriber growth beat analyst estimates by a wide margin in both the U.S. and international segments. Some analysts had been concerned that it couldn\'t maintain the growth it had in the past as it scales and that the U.S. market was reaching saturation. That report seemed to put those concerns to rest for the time being. \n\nIt\'s too soon to see if subscriber additions will be impacted by the recent price hikes in the U.S. When the company hiked prices on its premium services in 2017, it indicated it hadn\'t seen any major attrition following the move. \n\n### Content Spending, Cash Flow and Other Costs\n\nOn a profit-and-loss basis, NFLX had forecasted that it would spend between $7.5 billion to $8 billion on content in 2018. Management has said that will increase in 2019, yet hasn\'t provided a specific outlook.  \n\nContent isn\'t the only area NFLX has been spending more and at the start of 2018 forecasted marketing spend would rise 56% to $2 billion and technology and development spending would increase 23% to $1.3 billion. \n\nThe company\'s hefty spending has resulted in a continual cash burn. In October, management said that its free cash flow for 2018 would come in around negative $3 billion and that 2019 would have similar levels. NFLX reported it had raised $2 billion through a debt offering in October, tacking on to its existing $12 billion in debt. \n\n### Growing Competition\n\nIt\'s no secret that there is growing competition in video streaming. **Walt DIsney  Co **(NYSE:DIS) is rolling out new services and is set to gain majority control of Hulu once its acquisition of assets from **21st Century Fox** (NASDAQ:FOXA) closes, **AT &T Inc. **(NYSE:T) has said it is planning a streaming service with its newly acquired Time Warner assets and **Comcast Corporation  **(NASDAQ:CMCSA) just announced its NBCUniversal division will launch one too. Tack on existing competition like **Amazon.com, Inc.  **(NASDAQ:AMZN) and players like **Apple Inc  **(NASDAQ:AAPL) reportedly working on their own services, and the market is a far cry from what it was just a few years ago. \n\nNFLX CEO Reed Hastings has regularly acknowledged direct competition, as well as video games, social media, magazines, and all the other forms of entertainment the company is up against. In last quarter\'s investor letter, he said "our job is to make Netflix stand out so that when consumers have free time, they choose to spend it with our service." One part of the company\'s strategy to do that has been to increasingly produce original content that viewers can\'t get anywhere else. \n\n**Wild Ride**. In December, NFLX got all the way back down to $230, close to where it started the year, after peaking at an all-time high of $423.21 in June. The stock snapped back once it got down to that major area of support and has rallied all the way back to above $350. The past few days, the stock has struggled to get over the $360 mark, a level of resistance. Chart source: thinkorswim® by TD Ameritrade. Not a recommendation. _For illustrative purposes only.

Implied volatility was at the 61st percentile as of this morning. \n\nIn short-term trading at the Jan. 18 monthly expiration, calls have been active at the 350 and 360 strike prices. On the call side there has also been higher volume at the 380 and 400 strikes, a ways out of the money. For puts, recent volume has been concentrated at the 345 and 350 strikes. The 355-strike put has also been active and the stock was briefly trading above that level on Tuesday. \n\nThere hasn\'t been much activity in the next several weekly expirations that stands out. At the Feb. 15 monthly expiration, calls have been active at the 350 strike while puts have been active at the 330 and 340 strikes.\n\n_Information from TDA is not intended to be investment advice or construed as a recommendation or endorsement of any particular investment or investment strategy, and is for illustrative purposes only.

According to Faucette, Paypal is now accepted by 82 percent of the top 500 U.S. internet retailers, up from 81 percent last quarter.\n\nPaypal\'s closest digital wallet rival, **Amazon.com, Inc.** (NASDAQ:AMZN), saw the acceptance rate of its Amazon Pay service fall slightly from 13 percent last quarter to just 12 percent today. **Visa, Inc.** (NYSE:V) wallet Visa Checkout gained zero net new merchants in the quarter, and its acceptance rate remains at 9 percent. **Mastercard Inc** (NYSE:MA) gained one net merchant in the quarter to bring its acceptance rate to 6 percent.\n\nOn the cryptocurrency front, Faucette said bitcoin once again failed to add a single new merchant for the fifth consecutive quarter. Bitcoin\'s acceptance rate among the top 500 U.S. retail merchants remains under 1 percent.\n\n### Room For Upside\n\nThe latest numbers from Morgan Stanley suggest PayPal is the clear market leader in U.S. digital wallets.\n\n"While PYPL has held up relatively well vs. Payments peers the last couple of months, we still see room for upside to the stock,given PYPL\'s high revenue growth, largely discretionary opex,and compounding earnings profile," Faucette wrote.\n\nMorgan Stanley has an Overweight rating and $99 price target for Paypal.\n\nPaypal\'s stock traded at $90.29 per share Thursday morning.\n\n_Related Links:_\n\n_Guggenheim\'s Positive Outlook For Payments Stocks: \'We Expect Strong Results\'_\n\n_2018: The Year Of The Bitcoin Bust?_'
 'Shipping trends of 2019 are requiring established freight carriers to evolve their operational models. **UPS**(NYSE:UPS) is developing more super-hubs to facilitate growth through handling more high margin shipments.\n\nThe new "super-hub" strategy developed by UPS is built on a network of newly established regional hubs across the U.S. These facilities are located in Atlanta, Georgia; Dallas/Ft. Worth, Texas; Phoenix, Arizona; Salt Lake City, Utah; and Indianapolis, Indiana. UPS issued a press release which stated these hubs are highly automated to support multiple high-capacity options during peak volumes. These facilities are adding five million square feet to UPS\' capacity to increase the flexibility and reliability of its network.\n\nUPS also opened 22 new facilities worldwide with a focus on automation to achieve 25-35 percent higher efficiency. The company stated that this upgrade added 350,000 piece per hour throughput (the amount of material passing through UPS\' network) in the U.S. In addition, UPS added 300 new brown delivery trucks to its fleet. The overall goal of UPS\' new developments in 2018 were to prevent a repeat of delays that occurred during the holiday season of 2017.\n\nDon\'t miss it. Register today.\n\nThe _World Economic Forum_ reported that UPS is using AI-based technology to analyze worker activity in distribution facilities. This enables UPS to acquire valuable training data and incorporate machine-learning to improve its operations. These innovations contribute to 100,000 parcels being processed through UPS\' Atlanta super-hub every hour.\n\nHowever, as reported by FreightWaves SONAR, UPS struggled on the stock market throughout 2018, with share values declining 30 percent from a peak of $129.85 on January 12 to a low of $89.89 on December 24. Rival FedEx fared even worse, as its stock dropped almost 44 percent in value from $271.48 on January 19 to $152.70 on December 24.\n\n(IMAGE: FREIGHTWAVES SONAR)\n\nMeanwhile, UPS\' competition has proven itself to be relentless. Amazon had a strong performance in 2018, in part because of its logistical innovations. _Forbes_ reported that **Amazon**(NASDAQ:AMZN)** ** deployed 100,000 robotic platforms to its 26 fulfillment (distribution) centers, which boosted the productivity of the facilities and their employees. A _CNBC_ article stated that FedEx neglected to publicly consider Amazon as a direct competitor in November, which may be perceived as a weakness. Rates for Amazon customers were 50 percent cheaper than those with UPS in 2018.\n\nFor its part, UPS has sought to compete with Amazon\'s innovations by conducting drone delivery trials. In 2016 the company partnered with drone manufacturer CyPhy Works to develop a durable, battery-powered, quadcopter delivery drone equipped with night-vision and secured communications. The drone will be used to delivery sensitive items such as medicine to remote locations like islands. UPS predicts that by 2020, the combined number of active commercial and hobbyist drones will reach seven million.\n\nThe capabilities of second-party logistics firms like UPS will be tested again in 2019 as the e-commerce market continues to expand and first-party shippers expand their own logistics services.\n\nWant more content like this?

 'Streaming video company **Netflix, Inc.** (NASDAQ:NFLX) could walk away as the Oscar\'s biggest winner after its critically acclaimed film "Roma" received a Best Picture nomination.\n\n### What Happened\n\nNetflix is no stranger to Academy Award nominations, but the film -- which follows the life of a live-in housekeeper to a middle-class family in Mexico -- is the company\'s first chance at bringing home the top prize. Netflix is up against a strong competitor in "Black Panther," which was the highest grossing film in North America in 2018 with more than $700 million in ticket sales.\n\nThe other nominees for best picture include:\n\n  * "A Star is Born"\n  * "Bohemian Rhapsody"\n  * "Green Book"\n  * "The Favourite"\n  * "Vice"\n  * "BlacKkKlansman"\n\n\n\n### Why It\'s Important\n\nNetflix could become the first streaming video company to take home the Best Picture title, although it wasn\'t the first to receive a nomination. **Amazon.com, Inc.** (NASDAQ:AMZN)\'s "Manchester By The Sea" lost the 2017 Best Picture award to "Moonlight."\n\nAlthough not directly tied to the Oscar nomination nod, a source close to the matter told CNBC\'s Julia Boorstin Netflix will be joining Hollywood\'s lobbying associating, the MPAA. If accurate, it will mark an important next step for Netflix is it signals it is "part of the Hollywood mainstream."\n\nMembers of the MPAA consist of only Hollywood studios and Netflix would be the first streaming video company to join, Boorstin said.\n\n_Related Links:_\n\n_A Sign Of Things To Come?

 'Small delivery robots started rolling down the sidewalks in the Seattle suburbs Wednesday as **Amazon.com, Inc.** (NASDAQ:AMZN) joined the unmanned home delivery space.\n\nAmazon joins other companies that deliver items -- including **Yum! Brands, Inc.** (NYSE:YUM)-owned Pizza Hut, **Domino \'s Pizza, Inc.** (NYSE:DPZ) and British food delivery company Just Eat -- in trying out small rolling robots for delivering to homes rather than relying on trucks, cars or bikes.\n\nAmazon\'s robot, Scout, looks kind of like a rolling cooler -- only nobody needs to pull it. The company said six of the devices began delivering packages in Snohomish County just north of Seattle on Wednesday.\n\nThe robots, which move at about the pace a human walks, will only be used during daylight hours -- at least for now -- and will initially be accompanied by an Amazon employee to make sure they safely avoid people, pets or anything else that might be in their path. They\'re powered by an electric battery.\n\n"We are delighted to welcome Amazon Scout into our community," Snohomish County Executive Dave Somers said in an Amazon blog post announcing the trial. "Similar to Amazon, we are always looking for new ways to better deliver service to our residents."\n\nDomino \'s has been trying out delivery via rolling robot coolers in New Zealand, and just this month, **PepsiCo, Inc.**(NASDAQ:PEP) started using similar robots, which it calls "snackbots," to deliver snacks and beverages on the campus of the University of the Pacific in California. \n\nPizza Hut is going in a slightly different direction, working with **Toyota Motor Corp** (NYSE:TM) on a self-driving pickup truck for automated deliveries. \n\nThe British are way ahead on the robot delivery game. Food delivery service Just Eat said in 2017 that it delivered its 1,000th meal using its fleet of 10 robots in London.\n\nStarship Technologies, an Estonian-American startup which has been making robot devices similar to those being used by Amazon, said late last year that it wants to also get in on robot package delivery and is testing devices in the San Francisco area.\n\nAmazon shares were up 0.48 percent at $1,640.02 at the close Wednesday. \n\n_Related Links:_\n\n_Pivotal Still Sees Plenty Of Growth Opportunities At Amazon_\n\n_Drones, Distribution And The State Of Shipping_\n\n_Photo courtesy of Amazon.  _\n\nShares of e-commerce platform **eBay Inc**  (NASDAQ:EBAY) were trading higher Wednesday after activist investors took stakes in the company, with one outlining a strategy that includes spinning off non-core businesses. \n\nAnalysts said the news that Elliott Management Corp. and Starboard Value had each taken a roughly 4-percent stake in eBay -- and that Elliott was demanding change -- are a positive for the stock, as it pressures management to cut costs and consider spin-offs.  \n\n### What Happened\n\nPaul Singer\'s Elliott Management announced Tuesday it had taken a $1.4-billion stake in eBay and sent a letter to its board outlining ideas for how eBay "can become a better and more valuable company."\n\nMedia outlets reported that another activist investor, Starboard Value, has also taken about a 4-percent interest in eBay.\n\n### Why It\'s Important\n\nIn its letter, Elliott said refocusing on eBay\'s core marketplace and making operational improvements could speed up growth and significantly improve the value of the stock, which it said has badly underperformed, causing investors to lose confidence.\n\n"Substantial and immediate change is required," the letter said.\n\nIn addition to the online marketplace business that most consumers associate with eBay, the company also owns eBay Classifieds Group and ticket seller StubHub.\n\n"These are both premier, strategic assets, and we believe that substantial value can be created by separating them from the core marketplace," Elliott Management said in the letter. "As a more focused and efficiently run business, we believe eBay can achieve a value of $55 to $63-plus per share by the end of 2020, representing upside of more than 75-100 percent within the next two years."\n\n### Analysts React\n\nThe interest from the new investors is a positive for the stock, Bank of America Merrill Lynch analyst Justin Post said in a Wednesday note.\n\nBofA reiterated a Neutral rating on eBay and lifted its price target from $34 to $38.\n\n"We agree with the spirit of the analysis in the sense that there is additional value in a sum-of-the-parts scenario, and the implied core eBay marketplace is low," the analyst said. \n\nPost said he agreed with Elliott that margin trends have been disappointing and that cost-cutting opportunities exist. \n\nWhat the letter didn\'t have an answer for was low sales growth and the ongoing loss of market share to competitors **Amazon.com, Inc.** (NASDAQ:AMZN) and **Walmart Inc**(NYSE:WMT).\n\n"We think the biggest issue for the stock is the concern that U.S. (gross merchandise volume) growth could turn negative," the analyst said. \n\n### KeyBanc Sticks With Bullish Stance \n\nKeyBanc Capital Markets agrees with Elliott\'s analysis and that activist investors could spur urgency at eBay, analyst Edward Yruma\n\nsaid in a Tuesday note.\n\nKeyBanc reiterated an Overweight on eBay with a $43 price target. \n\n"Management has been working aggressively to pivot the core marketplace business to become a destination of deals, rather than strictly an online swap meet," Yruma said. "Fundamental to this pivot is an improved user experience (product-based landing pages, intermediated payments, among others)."\n\nYruma said eBay could attractive to a buyer.\n\n"We believe that the core marketplace business could have significant strategic value to a U.S.-focused e-commerce player looking to gain scale."\n\nWalmart is one example of a player in search of an e-commerce business, the analyst said. \n\n_Related Links:_\n\n_Aegis Lowers eBay Revenue Estimate On European Economic Softness, Strong Dollar_\n\n_Morgan Stanley Downgrades eBay On Slower GMV Growth_\n\n_What To Do With eBay Now?

 'The rise of ecommerce has truly shrunk supply chain timelines, speeding up consumer expectations in its wake. Deliveries to a consumer\'s door that took a week a decade ago take only two days today, courtesy of the tight delivery schedules that have now become the norm.\n\nChinese ecommerce behemoth **JD.com, Inc.** (NASDAQ:JD) is turning delivery schedules up a notch by introducing delivery drones in Indonesia and completing its first "government approved" drone delivery earlier this month.\n\n"The test flight took place on January 8, 2019, in West Java, Indonesia, where the drone flew from Jagabita Village, Parung Panjang to MIS Nurul Falah Leles Elementary School to deliver backpacks and books to students. The items delivered by drone were part of a larger donation of supplies from JD.com to the school," said JD.com in a statement released today.\n\nBecause of consumer demand, the logistics industry meets difficult last-mile delivery schedules of next-day and even same-day when necessary. Businesses realize the significance of delivery timeframes for consumer retention and brand loyalty. Expectations drive results; companies are working under ever-tighter schedules, or lose market share to others who do.\n\nDon\'t miss it. Register today.\n\nThough **Amazon.com, Inc.** (NASDAQ:AMZN)** ** pioneered many innovative techniques at both the warehouse level and the last-mile stretch, JD.com has been busy with automating lynchpin nodes along its supply chain to expedite cargo movement. For instance, the company runs an automated warehouse in Kunshan, China, that is entirely managed by a swarm of robots. The warehouse can handle 200,000 orders a day and employs only four people - whose role is to service the robots.\n\nJD.com banks on a robust last-mile delivery system in China, allowing it to deliver goods on the same day they are ordered - even to the remotest corner of the country. The only requirement that JD.com sets to ensure same-day delivery is that it receives the order before 11:00 a.m. To keep up the delivery pace and to expand its range beyond the reach of last-mile delivery vans, the company oversees an armada of delivery drones that have been in use for the past couple of years.\n\nJD.com\'s foray into Indonesia should arouse considerable interest, as the country presents the challenges of a large population and a unique terrain. Indonesia is the world\'s largest archipelago; 260 million Indonesians live across 17,000 islands. This makes it difficult for last-mile logistics companies to deliver by road; not all the islands are well connected by bridges. Drone delivery could be a perfect fit, as it not only negates the need for expensive infrastructure to be in place for movement, but also drastically cuts down delivery times.\n\nTo bring high-quality e-commerce to Indonesia, JD.com has partnered with JD.id, its Indonesian counterpart. Since its launch in 2016, JD.id has grown rapidly, serving 20 million consumers across the country, delivering in 483 cities and 6,500 counties. JD.id has set some ambitious goals relating to delivery times, looking to fulfill 85 percent of its orders either on the same day as an order or the next day. Adding delivery drones to its last-mile fleet would go a long way to achieving its target.\n\nLast year, JD.com unveiled its first unmanned store in Indonesia (and incidentally its first such store outside of China). Called X-Mart, the brick-and-mortar storefront is similar to Amazon Go stores in the U.S. Customers walk in, pick items off the shelf, and leave the store without waiting in checkout lanes to bill the products. The AI-powered store will automatically add the selected items to customers\' accounts, letting them pay for them through their JD.com accounts.\n\nRevamping the way ecommerce works is critical to gaining favor among consumers and to repeatedly earn their business. Like Amazon and Alibaba, JD.com is constantly innovating and disrupting its supply chain to hold its place in its heavily contested markets. Its involvement in drone delivery is in-line with those ambitions.\n\nWant more content like this?

By removing the walls between each step of the supply chain, digitization will create a network that is more resilient and responsive to change.\n\nBut digitization is merely a means to an end, and that end is greater visibility along all steps of the supply chain. Jeff Tucker, the CEO of Tucker Company Worldwide, said that his goal as a freight broker is to electronically track 100 percent of his loads by the end of the calendar year.\n\nBecause of the high number of carriers competing for loads, Tucker said that his team will begin turning down carriers who will not agree to tracking. That tracking is necessary for freight brokers as competition increases to win business from shippers.\n\nTracking data, along with other info gleaned from electronic logging devices, must become shared among carriers, shippers and brokers to truly increase efficiency, said Kevin Perry, owner of The Domestic Transportation Consultant.\n\nOnce the data is shared, brokers and others can forecast supply and demand trends to reduce wasted time and money.\n\nAccurate forecasting and analytics will require "tight, close-knit relationships with customer service and the supply team," Perry said.\n\nBoth shippers and carriers have been dissuaded from pursuing supply chain digitization due to the cost of the investments in the necessary technology. However, major shippers are spending $50 billion in 2019 to update the technology involved in their supply chains, said Jon Slangerup, executive chairman and CEO of American Global Logistics.\n\n"In our industry, I see billions if not trillions in reductions of overall costs [thanks to the investments in technology]," he said.  \n\nWhile come carriers may be willing to accept digitization as part of the cost of doing business, other 2019 trends will be harder to swallow.\n\n2018 saw the rise of compliance fees -- fines which occur when shippers fail to deliver loads on time -- imposed by big-box retailers to match increasing consumer demand, and those are likely to continue rising in 2019.\n\nThese fees occur when deliveries are missed, rescheduled, or overall service is poor. Fees can range from 2-3 percent of invoices to hundreds of dollars per load. According to Tucker, 2018 was the most disruptive year for compliance fees. The rise of **Amazon.com, Inc.** (NASDAQ:AMZN) is increasing pressure on retailers (and the transportation companies that service them) to increase performance and efficiency in order to meet consumer demand for on-time deliveries.\n\n"Never in the 60 years we\'ve been in business has customer service and on-time service been as important as today," said Tucker. "In an environment of compliance fees, some companies are seeing hundreds of thousands in fees every year."\n\nTucker also said that while big carriers are still growing, the number of small carriers (companies with fleets between one and 100 trucks) has grown much faster. The number of drivers for hire has increased as well.\n\nDon\'t miss it. Register today.\n\nThe supply chain in 2019 will also likely see the rise of new competitors and changing ground rules in the freight market, said Slangerup.\n\n"We\'re probably at a time of the greatest disruption I\'ve seen," said Slangerup. "The top of the list is the uncertainty around the world because of Washington... changes in relationships since the current administration took power. It\'s affecting trade relationship and business relationships."\n\nAs transportation companies become more technologically integrated, tech-focused companies are taking note and expanding into logistics operations, Slangerup said.\n\nHe singled out Flexport, a Silicon Valley-based freight forwarder as a polar opposite to AGL, which itself is a logistics company moving into technology.\n\n"It\'s a new competitive dynamic," said Slangerup, though he noted that AGL is making adjustments in anticipation of new competitors.\n\nWant more content like this?

Nowhere, however, are they more prevalent than in the parcel industry. At last count, **FedEx Corp**. (NYSE:FDX) and **UPS Inc**. (NYSE:UPS) the industry\'s dominant players, each have about 85 accessorial charges, according to Shipware, LLC, a consultancy. Of those, about 35 are considered commonplace and have meaningful impact, Shipware said.\n\nParcel shippers find most accessorials, of which fuel surcharges is probably the most well-known, to be the shipping equivalent of death by a thousand cuts. More accessorials are added every year and the prices of existing ones are often raised annually. The impact of accessorials has reached a point where they can account for 20 to 30 percent of the total cost of a typical residential delivery. This has led many shippers to wonder if the charges aren\'t more a way of fattening the carriers\' top and bottom lines than a proffer of fair value for additional services. The carriers defend accessorials as a proper way to be compensated for the cost, and often the hassle, of providing these extra services.\n\nIf published reports are accurate, **Amazon.com, Inc**. (NASDAQ:AMZN) appears to have a plan to free shippers from accessorial bondage. The company plans to lower or eliminate accessorial fees such as fuel surcharges and residential surcharges as part of an expanded pilot program to pick up goods at customer facilities and deliver them directly to consumers within a 7-day window. The story appeared in the Wall Street Journal. As reported by FreightWaves and other media outlets, Amazon has been developing a plan to pick up freight at the shipper\'s location and deliver it to one of its fulfillment centers. The pilot debuted in Los Angeles and Orange County, Calif. In December 2017\n\nThe program, known as "Shipping With Amazon," (SWA) has been framed as a way for Amazon to keep up with its burgeoning volumes while maintaining its delivery commitments. It handles about 10 percent of its own traffic. About 62 percent are handled by the U.S. Postal Service, 21 percent by UPS and 7 percent by FedEx, according to data from ShipMatrix. In the process, however, rates for the SWA service have undercut UPS and FedEx by up to 50 percent or more, according to Ravi Shanker, analyst for **Morgan Stanley & Co**. (NYSE:MS). Shanker, who is bearish on UPS and neutral on FedEx largely due to the threat posed by Amazon, said in a note today that eliminating accessorials would make Amazon\'s offerings even more competitive against the established players.\n\nHowever, Amit Mehrotra, analyst for Deutsche Bank, said Amazon has neither the last-mile delivery scale or density to act on such a purported pledge, which is why USPS still handles so much of its traffic. In a note, Mehrotra said that Amazon is hinting at dis-intermediating UPS, and to a lesser extent FedEx, in order to extract lower costs from its providers just as any big buyer would. Until Amazon is "ready to talk" about the billions of dollars it will need to build out its own network, reports about it throwing its partners under the bus paint an unrealistic picture of the implications for FedEx and UPS, he wrote.\n\nDon\'t miss it. Register today.\n\nJames Thomson, a former top Amazon executive and head of Buy Box Experts, a consultancy that helps companies sell online, said the initiative continues Amazon\'s more than year-long strategy of erecting a delivery network to compete with FedEx, UPS, and others for non-Amazon users who sell goods on other websites. "The bigger this business gets for Amazon, the more shipping capacity it will have for periods when it matters most, which is the fourth quarter," Thomson said in a LinkedIn post. "So, Amazon builds out capacity, lowers its costs, and passes along cost savings to sellers, the whole while continuing to use UPS and FedEx for more (high-cost sorting operations) that it doesn\'t immediately want to build itself."\n\nJesse Cohen, a long-time air cargo executive and now FreightWaves\' market expert-air cargo, said the "aggressive focus" on residential deliveries "is a natural and reasonable extension of the Amazon product line." Selling delivery services with little or no accessorials "is not really a model for ongoing profitability," Cohen said. He added, however, that Amazon has deep pockets and may choose to operate at breakeven or even take modest losses to get established.\n\nRob Martinez, Shipware\'s founder and CEO, said that if the _Journal_ story is accurate, Amazon is barking up the wrong delivery tree. "Seven-day delivery is not what shippers are asking for. Ironically, they want delivery within 2 days, which is a direct result of the `Amazon Effect,\'" Martinez said.\n\nEven if the devil is in the details, what is clear is that Amazon wants to build delivery density to make residential routes profitable, according to Martinez. He added that the incumbents need to be very mindful of the 800-pound gorilla in their midst. "No matter the brave face we\'re seeing applied at FedEx and UPS, today\'s news has got to leave them feeling extraordinarily vulnerable and uneasy," he said.\n\nWant more content like this?

 'After taking a closer look at several of the more prominent bear-bull debates surrounding **Wayfair Inc** (NYSE:W), Credit Suisse is confident to make the bullish case for the online home goods and furniture company.\n\n### The Analyst\n\nCredit Suisse\'s Stephen Ju upgraded Wayfair from Neutral to Outperform with a price target lifted from $117 to $130.\n\n### The Thesis\n\nThe first of three hotly contested debates among Wayfair bulls and bears is the company\'s longer-term growth outlook. Encouragingly, Wayfair\'s management team offered recent comments that its smaller international business (Canada, UK and Germany) are seeing smaller repeat order rates, cohort characteristics, and gross margins compared to the more established U.S. business. This should give investors more confidence in the company\'s expansion into new markets and a near-to-medium term sustainability of its category lead.\n\nJu said Wayfair\'s positive outlook by itself isn\'t sufficient to convert bears given ongoing pressure to Wayfair\'s bottom line. But the company is tackling its investments in growth from a "position of strength" and an aggressive ramp of marketing spend and headcounts would be seen as taking advantage of strong momentum. 2021 should mark the first year both the international and U.S. businesses the company sees a net profit contribution per gross customer add at $4 and $26, respectively and expand to $27 and $45 by 2024, respectively.\n\nFinally, **Amazon.com, Inc.** (NASDAQ:AMZN) and other online company\'s continue pushing into the furniture space and related concerns may be overblown, the analyst said. These include:\n\n  * Amazon\'s lack of a highly visual and curated platform;\n  * A focus on private label brands gives Wayfair an advantage of Amazon in price; and\n  * Although less of an advantage against Amazon, Wayfair boasts a "head start" in building out a strong supply chain system.\n\n\n\n### Price Action\n\nShares of Wayfair closed higher by 2.2 percent at $104.44 Monday afternoon.\n\n_Related Links:_\n\n_BofA Cites Growth Deceleration, Elevated Expenses, Valuation In Neutral Turn On Wayfair_\n\n_Industry Strength Leads To RH Upgrade_\n\n**Amazon.com, Inc.**(NASDAQ:AMZN), which started out as an  online retailer, followed its e-commerce play with ventures into businesses that include the cloud, home automation and entertainment. \n\nWith reports suggesting the online behemoth is  planning  to tap into the home design and construction segment through a tie-up with homebuilder **Meritage Homes Corp**(NYSE:MTH), Morgan Stanley delved into what could be prompting such a move. \n\n### The Analyst\n\nAnalyst Brian Nowak has an Overweight rating  on Amazon with a $2,400 price target.\n\n### The Thesis\n\nAmazon\'s move likely deals with attaching lockers to houses, placing multiple lockers in communal areas and installing smart garages into new homes in order to facilitate secure delivery of  packages  by couriers, Nowak said in a Friday note. \n\nAmazon has reportedly forged relationships with a group of upscale apartment buildings in Texas and Oregon to offer a service called "Easier with Amazon" that would give tenants "a free year of Amazon Prime, a free Amazon Echo with installation and Amazon lockers for deliveries," the analyst said. \n\nNowak outlined three reasons for Amazon\'s purported interest in home design, which he said will have long-term benefits: \n\n  * Apartment dwellers and homeowners would be conditioned to shop on Amazon.\n  * Echo-optimized appliances and homes would open up additional opportunities for the company in grocery, consumer packaged goods, digital media, home insurance, in-home security and more. \n  * Amazon-designed homes could reduce theft losses and improve last-mile delivery efficiency.\n\n\n\nThe security and efficiency of last mile delivery is important, as Amazon is continuing to work on profitably growing and scaling its lower-margin, $800-billion grocery business through 1-2-hour delivery offerings, the analyst said. \n\n"Last-mile grocery shipping costs can make up 12 percent of revenue," Nowak said. "Improved delivery efficiency and throughput through digitally locked, temperature-controlled Amazon in-home boxes or mini \'Amazon receiving rooms\' could materially help Amazon drive higher long-term profitability even as grocery grows in the mix." \n\n### The Price Action\n\nAmazon shares were down 2.17 percent at $1,634.26 at the time of publication Monday. \n\n_Related Links:_\n\n_Pivotal Still Sees Plenty Of Growth Opportunities At Amazon_\n\n_UPS Zeroes In On\'Super-Hubs,\' High-Margin Shipments To Grow Business _\n\n_Photo courtesy of Amazon.  _\n\nIt\'s crunch time, and that doesn\'t just mean the crunch of snow under boots as more snow and extreme cold blow into much of the country.\n\nThis is arguably the most crucial earnings week of the season, with names ranging from **Boeing Co  **(NYSE:BA) to **Apple Inc  **(NASDAQ:AAPL) to **Amazon.com, Inc.  **(NASDAQ:AMZN) opening their books. About 25% of S&P 500 companies report over the next five days. In addition, Friday brings the closely watched January payrolls report. On top of all that, a Fed meeting starts tomorrow.\n\n**Caterpillar Inc  **(NYSE:CAT) kicked off the fun early Monday, missing analysts\' average earnings projections by quite a bit (see more below). That, along with new concerns about China\'s economy and worries about another government shutdown, appeared to put pressure on stocks in pre-market trading. The shutdown may have ended last week, but things still aren\'t settled.\n\nOverseas, the British pound was higher to start the week, helping drag down British stocks ahead of another week of Brexit meetings.\n\n### Full Plate of Earnings On Tap\n\nLooking at this week\'s earnings schedule, both the industrial and tech sectors stand out. Results could help investors get a better sense of the economy\'s path and consumer health in Q4. \n\nThat\'s only part of the story however. Investors might also want to listen and watch closely for company guidance, as well as any remarks from executives about how they see 2019 shaping up. This is always important, but probably has more impact this year considering all the geopolitical plates spinning. One question is how the government shutdown might have affected business for some firms.\n\nCAT got things started early Monday. Earnings per share of $2.55 were well below the third-party consensus estimate. Revenue of $14.34 billion was a little above average analyst estimates. The company forecast a "modest" sales increase in 2019, but its earnings guidance range looked on the light side. Shares of CAT fell 6% in pre-market trading, and the company cited increased materials and tariff costs. Sales fell in the Asia/Pacific region.\n\nThis is a little concerning, though nothing to necessarily get too worried about. CAT is just one company, and we\'ll have to see what other major industrial companies report. From a buildings and construction view, the weakness in Asia doesn\'t look that great.\n\nBA has warned that the government shutdown could end up hurting its business, as well as that of the overall airline industry. So it could be interesting to see whether company executives discuss this further, especially in light of Friday\'s news of a temporary reopening. Other major companies on tap next this week include **AT &T Inc** (NYSE:T), **Verizon Communications Inc  **(NYSE:VZ), **Microsoft Corporation  **(NASDAQ:MSFT), **Tesla Inc  **(NASDAQ:TSLA), **Amazon.com, Inc.  **(NASDAQ:AMZN), **McDonald \'s Corp **(NYSE:MCD), and **Lockheed Martin Corporation**  (NYSE:LMT). \n\nEarnings from Apple are likely to get a very close look tomorrow afternoon after the company\'s previous earnings and outlook disappointed many investors and helped send the widely-held stock into a tailspin. Another blow came earlier this month when AAPL dialed back its fiscal Q1 revenue expectations, a rare event. The company is no longer breaking out iPhone unit sales, so it might be more challenging to get a sense of exactly how that important product is performing.\n\nAAPL and AMZN, in particular, could help investors better understand how consumer demand looked during the holiday shopping season. Some major retailers reported disappointing holiday sales stats earlier this month, and consumer confidence sagged in the latest University of Michigan sentiment report.\n\nAbout 72% of the companies that had reported earnings as of Friday morning have beaten expectations, according to CNBC. In terms of revenue, however, there are just 58% that beat forecasts, down from about 70% in recent quarters. That means a fair number of companies are missing analysts\' revenue expectations, something perhaps to monitor as this week rolls along.\n\nTicker Tape will be running previews of a number of earnings reports starting today, so stay tuned.\n\n### Rates Not Seen Changing, But Fed Meeting Could Bring Key Insights\n\nIt\'s tempting to downplay the importance of this week\'s Fed meeting, considering the heavy load of earnings and data on tap in coming days. Despite all that--and the market dialing in about a 99% chance of the Fed standing pat on rates--the meeting likely deserves close scrutiny. Two reasons come to mind. \n\nFirst, the Fed could shed more light on Friday\'s Wall Street Journal report saying Fed officials are closer to ending the central bank\'s bond portfolio wind-down. While the Fed\'s interest rate trajectory has been closely scrutinized, the unwinding of its balance sheet has also been a form of hawkish monetary policy. Perhaps we might learn additional detail about what level of balance sheet holdings the Fed might want to maintain. This could play into the path of Treasury yields and provide clues about future borrowing costs.\n\nThe other reason not to ignore the Fed meeting is the accompanying press conference from Fed Chair Jerome Powell. He\'s going to speak after every Fed meeting this year, not just quarterly. \n\nBeyond all that, It could also be interesting to try to read the tea leaves in the language accompanying the Fed\'s decision. Investors may be looking for clues about the Fed\'s thinking on the impact of the trade war with China. There\'s also the question of whether the Fed sees any potential economic ramifications from the recent government shutdown.\n\n### Coming Off Strength\n\nStocks finished the old week on a high note. Buying momentum continued amid news of a deal to temporarily reopen the U.S. government. The administration and Congress struck a deal to end the partial government shutdown for three weeks. \n\nAs the deadline of Feb. 15 starts to draw closer, stocks might start getting a bit more volatile. However, it\'s arguable that the shutdown didn\'t really have a major impact on trading this time around. More shutdown fears surfaced early Monday after President Trump said over the weekend that there\'s still a chance of another one.\n\nThe market also gained support Friday after Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told Reuters that the United States and China were "making a lot of progress" on talks to end the ongoing trade war that has sparked worries about global economic growth and weighed heavily on companies\' outlooks. His comments served as a counterpoint to less optimistic talk earlier in the week from Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross. \n\nChina was in the news again early Monday. It reported industrial profits for December falling by 1.9%, the second monthly decline in a row. For all of 2018, the figure rose 10.3%, about half the level seen in 2017.\n\nLast week was the fifth-straight week of gains for the Dow Jones Industrial Average ($DJI), marking a solid start to the new year. However, the S&P 500 (SPX) failed to achieve a fifth-consecutive winning week, falling just a few points short.\n\nVolatility eased as the old week ended, with the VIX falling back below 18. It had been above 20 earlier in the week amid concerns about global economic data and a possible U.S.-China impasse on trade. Still, with all these earnings and the Fed meeting coming up, it seems unlikely that VIX would come down much further anytime soon. VIX was back above 18 early Monday.\n\n**Figure 1** : U.S. crude futures jumped again amid ongoing political turmoil in Venezuela.

Past performance does not guarantee future results._\n\n**Reading Between the Lines** : With a bevy of large companies reporting quarterly results in coming days, including global economic bellwether Caterpillar, now may be a good time for the market to glean some solid insight into two of the highest profile issues of the day: the economic effects of the U.S.-China trade war and the partial U.S. government shutdown. The trade dispute has been going on long enough that companies may talk about it in their earnings releases. But investors may also want to pay attention to executive commentary during conference calls as they might provide what analysts call "color" on how the issue is affecting their business or how they think it might affect it in the future. And those conference calls with analysts and investors may also provide more clarity on executives\' thinking on whether the government shutdown has impacted their businesses. \n\n**Grounded** : Flying is a great way to catch the flu. Being stuck inside an aluminum tube with dozens of other people for hours on end just increases the likelihood of germ transfer. On Friday, an increase in staff calling in sick led the Federal Aviation Administration to reroute air traffic and increase the time between flights, the FAA said in a statement. FAA employees have been working without pay during the partial government shutdown. **Delta Air Lines, Inc.** (NYSE:DAL) tweeted that the company during the morning was experiencing about 200 flight delays at Laguardia Airport. For those who waited for a flight in New York and want a silver lining, perhaps public pressure from the widening effects of the government shutdown helped spark a quicker resolution to the funding impasse.\n\n**GDP Forecast Lowered** : With the partial U.S. government shutdown keeping the Bureau of Economic Analysis shuttered, it seems unlikely that investors will see one of the agency\'s biggest reports in coming days. Originally scheduled for release on Wednesday, the bureau\'s first estimate of Q4 GDP appears likely to be delayed as the agency hasn\'t been funded during the shutdown. Investors and company leaders looking to fill the data vacuum may want to consider the latest 4Q GDP forecast from the Atlanta Fed. Its freshest GDPNow model estimate, released Friday, forecasts a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 2.7%, down from 2.8% on Jan. 18. The Atlanta Fed lowered the estimate after data from the National Association of Realtors showed a larger-than-expected decline in existing home sales. Now that data is trickling back in with the government reopened, investors might want to keep an eye on the Atlanta Fed\'s GDP forecast for an update.\n\n_Information from TDA is not intended to be investment advice or construed as a recommendation or endorsement of any particular investment or investment strategy, and is for illustrative purposes only.

 'Earnings season is in full swing and the market has seemingly been unfazed by what might otherwise be impactful report deliveries. Things like a disappointing bottom line report from **Netflix, Inc.**(NASDAQ:NFLX) and extremely mixed signals from financials like **Wells Fargo**(NYSE:WFC)**** and **Citigroup, Inc.** (NYSE:C) have done little to disrupt the overall momentum that has carried the market higher through most of January.\n\nTechnically, the S&P 500 is in a very interesting spot relative to its long term pattern. In mid-January, the index approached to within a percent of its 2018 entrance price after losing all of last year\'s gains over the final months of 2018.\n\nJanuary\'s gains put the index at a level its gotten very familiar with, a phenomenon that becomes clear in the chart below, taken stock research platform Finscreener.\n\nThe S&P 500 revisited that level, just under 2670, several times throughout 2018. In those times, volatility skyrocketed, but the index ultimately lurched forward until the next dramatic fall. That trend is seemingly repeating itself, with the volatility index climbing about 10 percent in the week starting in the approach to 2670.\n\nIts difficult to predict what hitting this level once again might mean for the broad market, but individual stocks could provide an indication of the patterns forming around this larger trend. With the help of Finscreener\'s technical summary tools, we\'ll take a look at the technical health of a few S&P stocks set to report in the final week of the month.\n\nBelow is a list of companies due to report the week of January 27, alongside their technical ratings based on moving averages and overall technical health.\n\nThe strongest positive technical signals emerging from the chart are the daily and weekly moving averages. Within that trend, there are a couple pairs of companies that share same industry, like **Mastercard Inc.**(NYSE:MA) and **Visa Inc.** (NYSE:V) and **Merck & Co., Inc.** (NYSE:MRK) and **Pfizer Inc.** (NYSE:PFE), whose technical health puts them in a strong position to react to their counterparts\' results.\n\nHowever, the technical outlook on traditional market leaders like **Apple Inc.** (NASDAQ:AAPL) and **Facebook Inc.** (NASDAQ:FB) is decidedly negative across the board. While earnings beat could likely help to shift the near-term chart trend, the overall trajectory of these stocks might still be negative should volatility persist.\n\nOn the other hand, mega caps **Amazon.com, Inc.**(NASDAQ:AMZN) and **Boeing Co.** (NYSE:BA), which are up YTD 10.4 and 13 percent respectively, both have an overall "Buy" rating based on their weekly technicals. Strong numbers from either will likely reverberate through the broad market, although growth prospects for Amazon have diminished in recent quarters, which might be reflected in their Q4 report, and Boeing has already felt a lift from **United Technologies Corporation** (NYSE:UTX) strong report the previous week that could mute even a solid set of results.\n\nWhile the broad market\'s long term trend might pose some resistance as the last leg of earnings roll out, those numbers might tip the scale as to whether the market can break its historical levels, or if equity is in store for more uncertainty as 2019 unfolds.\n\n**Ethan Allen Interiors Inc.** (NYSE:ETH) reported second-quarter adjusted EPS of 46 cents Monday, in-line with consensus estimates. The company is taking initiatives to drive the top line, but it is up against a highly competitive market at home, and its international sales have slowed, according to KeyBanc Capital Markets.\n\n### The Analyst\n\nAnalyst Bradley Thomas maintains a Sector Weight rating on Ethan Allen Interiors.\n\n### The Thesis\n\nEthan Allen\'s quarterly results reflect a decline in underlying trends, Thomas said in a Monday note.\n\nWhile international sales softened, the State Department orders that were delivered during the quarter involved highly competitive bids, the analyst said.\n\nComparative net sales grew 2.7 percent, but written comps declined by a meaningful 4.2 percent, Thomas said. The company\'s operating margin contracted 35 basis points to 8.33 percent, partly due to the competitive bids for the State Department orders, he said. \n\nThe furniture retailer expressed optimism regarding top-line growth going forward given its recently completed product refreshes, the analyst said. Ethan Allen has invested in its digital capabilities and introduced new merchandise for a younger target audience, he said. \n\nEthan Allen is poised to benefit from recent **Amazon.com, Inc.** (NASDAQ:AMZN) and **Walt Disney Co** (NYSE:DIS) launches as well as from a ramp up in State Department orders, Thomas mentioned. The analyst added that further traction needs to be seen "before getting more positive on the shares."M<\n\n### Price Action\n\nEthan Allen shares were slipping 6.35 percent to $17.56 at the time of publication Tuesday.\n\n_Related Links:_\n\n_Ethan Allen Announces Launch on Amazon\n\nMunster: Amazon Buying Target Still Makes Sense_\n\nTrucking companies fending off union efforts to organize contract drivers could benefit from an independent federal agency\'s decision expanding the definition of an independent contractor.\n\nIn ruling in favor of SuperShuttle, an airport shuttle-van service, the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) on Friday found that the company\'s franchisee drivers are not employees under the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA), but instead are independent contractors.\n\nIn doing so, the Board "returned to its long-standing independent contractor standard," it stated, and reaffirmed its adherence to the traditional common-law test. It also clarified the role "entrepreneurial opportunity" plays in determining whether workers are considered independent contractors.\n\nDon\'t miss it. Register today.\n\nIt noted that the decision, which ruled against a local transit union at Dallas-Fort Worth Airport, overrules a 2014 NLRB decision under the Obama Administration involving a dispute between **FedEx Corporation  **(NYSE:FDX) subsidiary FedEx Home Delivery and the Teamsters Union. That decision, the Board stated on Friday, had modified the test for determining independent contractor status and had limited the significance of a worker\'s "entrepreneurial opportunity" when trying to earn a living.\n\nIn the case of SuperShuttle, the drivers\' leasing or ownership of their work vans, method of compensation, and "nearly unfettered control" over their daily schedules provided them with significant entrepreneurial opportunity to make money, the Board found.\n\nUnder this new NLRB standard, all common-law factors will now be evaluated "through the prism of entrepreneurial opportunity" when circumstances warrant that analysis, the law firm Ogletree Deakins wrote in a commentary in the _National Law Review_. "In effect, the Board made entrepreneurial opportunity an important, overarching consideration in the analysis."\n\nThe debate over how a workforce is classified - employees versus independent contractor - for purposes of union organizing has been a simmering issue in the drayage sector at the country\'s two largest container port complexes, Los Angeles-Long Beach and New York-New Jersey.\n\nLast year striking contract drivers at **XPO Logistics Inc** (NYSE:XPO) and privately held NFI Industries at Southern California ports and area warehouses raised concerns among companies such as **Amazon.com, Inc.  **(NASDAQ:AMZN) that rely on them for keeping their supply chains moving.\n\nEfforts by the Teamsters to organize drayage truckers was aided by a California Supreme Court ruling last year making it more difficult to label workers as independent contractors.\n\nLearn more today\n\nThe NLRB\'s SuperShuttle decision, by contrast, expands the definition of "independent contractor" under the NLRA. It is most likely to benefit businesses that hire workers on a temporary or short-term basis, including those that have emerged as part of the "gig" economy such as Uber, according to Ogletree.\n\nWhile there may not yet be a strong correlation between gig economy companies and those that perform port drayage, "I think that any business that\'s looking at [the independent contractor] issue is going to want to look at this decision, especially if it\'s offering workers a great deal of flexibility in when and how they work," Ogletree lawyer Jesse Dill told FreightWaves.\n\n"Those are the types of businesses that unions will argue drivers are employees, but this decision will offer good support that they\'re independent contractors and can\'t be recognized as a union" under the NLRA.\n\nWant more content like this?

Its influence on stock indices, mutual funds and ETFs, as well as on investor holdings, mean that it has both a price and psychological influence on the market.\n\nWhen AAPL cut its quarterly revenue expectations earlier this month, it raised concerns not just about the health of the iPhone maker, but about consumer demand throughout the economy.\n\nOne primary theme investors have heard over the last six months is that the global economy might be slowing, but the consumer appears to be healthy. Considering Apple\'s consumer-driven product lineup, if the company experiences a slowdown, what does that truly mean for the consumer overall?\n\nTuesday afternoon might bring some answers as AAPL get set to release its fiscal Q1 earnings after the closing bell in what could be one of the more difficult earnings reports for the tech giant. However, some of the bad news might already be penciled in after AAPL\'s recent warning that it would miss its own revenue expectations by as much as 7%.\n\nAAPL earnings are part of a horde of major tech and internet companies reporting this week. Some of the others include **Microsoft Corporation  **(NASDAQ:MSFT), **Amazon.com, Inc.** , (NASDAQ:AMZN), and **Facebook**(NASDAQ:FB). Arguably none of these, however, have the outsize influence of AAPL, which surprised investors at its last earnings by announcing it would stop breaking out unit sales of the iPhone (see more below).\n\n### China Troubles\n\nAAPL shares took a plunge early this month after it announced in a letter from CEO Tim Cook that it was likely to see lower-than-expected revenue of $84 billion because of sliding iPhone sales in China, which AAPL blamed on ongoing tariff tensions between the U.S. and China. The company had previously guided for fiscal Q1 revenue of $89 billion to $93 billion. As some analysts noted at the time, it\'s very rare for AAPL to have to dial back its own expectations.\n\nSome Wall Street analysts have also said that AAPL\'s sales struggles in China may be due in part to increased competition there as well as the increasing price of iPhones. Recent economic data from China also points to slowing economic growth there, which could have implications for sales of AAPL products.\n\nBut AAPL stock has since rebounded this month, up 10% after recovering from a low of about $142 per share Jan. 3. It now trades near $156 per share.\n\nAAPL is now down about 8% over the past 52 weeks and is down about 30% in the past three months, roughly since its last quarterly report. Shares had peaked last fall at all-time highs above $230. See figure 1 below.\n\n### Apple\'s Revenue and Guidance on Watch\n\nThe consensus earnings estimate for AAPL is $4.17 per share, according to third-party estimates. Revenue is projected to fall slightly to $84 billion, down 4.8% from $88.3 billion in the same quarter last year.\n\nLast time out, AAPL reported Q4 earnings of $2.91 per share on revenue of $62.9 billion, both of which beat Street estimates. But shares plunged 7% to below its landmark $1 trillion-plus market cap after it reported iPhone sales of 46.9 million were essentially flat from the year prior. Compensating for the drag on sales, AAPL had increased the price of the iPhones so it reported an average selling price of $793 in Q4 2018, up 28% from the previous Q4.\n\nFor this quarter, investors will likely be watching for any changes or additions to AAPL\'s guidance, which could be more cautious, perhaps either because of possible ongoing struggles with iPhone sales or to prevent another disappointment. Guidance could also reflect AAPL\'s expectations for how the U.S.-China tariff tensions could play out, or how the trade policies could affect its bottom line.\n\nOne thing investors won\'t be watching for is specific iPhone sales numbers, as AAPL said last quarter it will no longer release those figures. Essentially, the company said it didn\'t want investors focusing on unit sales as a measure of the strength of its business. However, this quarter\'s numbers will now include specific gross margin and revenue from its services service business that includes fees from Apple Music and its App Store, so investors may get a sense of how those lines are faring.\n\nThere\'s been more internal focus on the services business growth in recent quarters, but also concern that iPhone demand could be fading as customers keep their phones longer or balk at higher prices for new models.\n\n**Figure 1: CLAWING BACK, BUT WELL OFF THE HIGHS.** AAPL shares gained back most of the 10% they lost in early January, when the company lowered its revenue outlook. However, shares sit well off the all-time high of 233 from a couple months prior. Data source: S&P Dow Jones Indices.

Despite the strain of **Apple Inc.** (NASDAQ:AAPL), QQQ\'s third-largest holding at a weight of 9.08 percent, being slightly lower to start 2019, the ETF is up 5.70 percent year-to-date.\n\nAnother Nasdaq-100 tracking ETF is having its say in the debate.\n\n**What Happened**\n\nThe**Direxion NASDAQ-100 Equal Weighted Index Shares** (NYSE:QQQE), the equal-weight alternative to QQQ, is off to a stellar start this year with a gain of 9.10 percent.

The risk is that when big-name stocks, say Apple or **Amazon.com Inc.**(NASDAQ:AMZN), drive the Nasda-100 Index higher, QQQE could trail the cap-weighted benchmark. Over the past three years, QQQE did lag QQQ, but the former did have less annualized volatility than the latter.\n\nWith Apple scuffling to start the year, QQQE\'s advantages are getting another look. The fund\'s start to the year is all the more impressive when considering **Microsoft Corp.**(NASDAQ:MSFT) and Amazon, which combine for over 18 percent of the cap-weighted Nasdaq-100, are trading higher.\n\n"If you\'re holding any of the NASDAQ-100 market-cap weighted funds, you have a highly weighted position in Apple and a majority weighting in the information technology sector!," said Direxion. "Apple is also the top holding of any index fund position you hold that tracks the S&P 500 Index. So much for diversifying away from single-security risk."\n\n### **What \'s Next **\n\nThe technology and communication services sectors combine for about two-thirds of the cap-weighted Nasdaq-100 Index, but just about 51 percent of QQQE. QQQE is noticeably overweight healthcare and industrial stocks relative to the traditional Nasdaq-100.\n\nInvestors added $22.58 million to QQQE last year.\n\n_Related Links_\n\n_Banks Bounce Back_\n\n__ESG ETFs Are Growing_ _\n\nVideo game and consumer electronics retailer **GameStop Corp.** (NYSE:GME) said Tuesday it\'s no longer pursuing a sale of itself.\n\n### What Happened\n\nReuters reported last June GameStop was pursuing a sale of itself with private equity firms but after months of discussions and consultations with advisers it has now "terminated efforts to pursue a sale." The company cited a "lack of available financing on terms that would be commercially acceptable to a prospective buyer."\n\nShares of GameStop tumbled 22 percent to $12.29 Tuesday morning in reaction to the announcement.\n\n### Why It\'s Important\n\nGameStop is the largest specialty retailer of video games in the U.S., but continues to struggle against online e-commerce companies like **Amazon.com, Inc.** (NASDAQ:AMZN), Variety reported. In fact, Amazon offers video gamers more competitive pricing and the ability to ship directly to consumers.\n\n### What\'s Next\n\nGameStop\'s management and board of directors are now in the process of evaluating how to best use the $735 million in cash proceeds it gained from divesting its Spring Mobile business.

 'How the tables have turned.\n\nLess than six months ago, a look at the top-three companies by market capitalization would have shown **Apple Inc.** (NASDAQ:AAPL) in first place with its then-$1 trillion market cap, followed by **Amazon.com, Inc.**  (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Google parent **Alphabet** (NASDAQ:GOOG).\n\nAt that time, **Microsoft Corporation  **(NASDAQ:MSFT), once the poster child for huge U.S. tech companies and the first public company to reach $500 billion in market cap way back in 1999, sat in fourth place on the list. However, that was before a Q4 that proved very harsh on the three leaders, and now MSFT once again holds first place on the leaderboard.\n\nIt\'s not as though MSFT stock didn\'t have its struggles toward the end of 2018. Like most of the tech sector, MSFT found its shares under pressure. However, they generally held up far better than rivals, perhaps in part because MSFT reported fiscal Q1 earnings for the quarter ended in September that easily beat analysts\' estimates, while the AMZNs and AAPLs of the world generally disappointed investors with their guidance in the same period. MSFT shares fell 11% between Sept. 30 and the end of the year, but were up about 3% so far in 2019 through late Tuesday. AAPL shares, in contrast, fell 30% in Q4.\n\nMSFT comes back with fiscal Q2 earnings on Wednesday after the close. The company is expected to report earnings per share of $1.09, according to third-party consensus estimates, up from $0.96 a year ago. Analysts expect the company to report fiscal Q2 revenue of $32.49 billion, up 12.4% from the same quarter a year earlier.\n\n**FIGURE 1: TOP DOG**. Microsoft shares (candlestick) have been outpacing those of Apple (AAPL - purple line) and Alphabet (GOOG - blue line) over the past six months, helping propel MSFT back to the top of the market capitalization chart. Chart source: The thinkorswim® platform from TD Ameritrade. For illustrative purposes only. Past performance does not guarantee future results.\n\n### Riding the Cloud; Skies of Azure\n\nThough MSFT\'s cloud business is likely to once again draw the most headlines when the company reports, its biggest segment is More Personal Computing--which includes Windows, devices, gaming products like Xbox and search ads. In fiscal Q1, this business line produced $10.7 billion in revenue, up 15% year over year, beating analysts\' estimates. Whatever else MSFT does, the health of this segment might seem to loom large in Q2.\n\n \n\nAnother business that throws major weight around at MSFT is its Productivity and Business Processes segment, which includes Office, LinkedIn and Dynamics. This segment accounted for just over $9.8 billion in Q1 revenue, up 19% year over year.\n\nThe Intelligent Cloud segment, which includes server products and cloud services, grew 24% in Q1 with $8.6 billion in revenue, according to the company\'s Q1 release. MSFT\'s biggest growth driver, according to some analysts, is its Azure public cloud, which competes with Amazon Web Services (AWS). Azure saw a slight slowdown in growth in Q1, to 76% from 89% in Q4. Any further slowing of growth in Q2 might bring up some questions, but when you\'re dealing with growth levels this high, comparisons might start to get tough. MSFT hasn\'t broken out revenue for Azure, so it\'s hard to say exactly how big an impact it\'s having on the overall business. MSFT said FY Q1 Azure growth was in line with its own expectations.\n\nBecause Azure is in the spotlight, MSFT shares sometimes move quickly after earnings based simply on results of this business, so investors might want to consider closely watching this particular number. MSFT shares fell 2% in the immediate aftermath of fiscal Q1 earnings as investors absorbed the lower Azure growth number, but then jumped back as investors pored over the rest of the company\'s data.\n\nMicrosoft says it has a hybrid cloud strategy, which includes sales of on-premises server products as well cloud services through Azure. Some analysts say this helps position MSFT well to take advantage of the overall transition toward cloud computing. As of fiscal Q1, Azure still appeared to be somewhat behind AWS in terms of percentage of cloud market sales, according to analysis firms quoted by the media. If Azure growth continues to slow, that could very well become a key focus of Wednesday\'s conference call.\n\nOne thing to consider watching is whether MSFT continued to increase Azure bookings during the quarter, as it said it did in fiscal Q1. This can be an imprecise way of measuring demand growth.\n\nHowever, investors might risk getting too wrapped up in Azure and miss other parts of the business. Fiscal Q1 saw LinkedIn revenue grow 33%, while gaming revenue rose 44%. Also, Surface revenue, which had been stagnant for a while, grew 14% in fiscal Q1, in part because of new models becoming available.\n\nSince MSFT is now the biggest company by market-cap in the world (at least for the moment), management\'s insight on the global economy might be an important aspect for investors to monitor in the earnings call. Other companies reporting so far this earnings season have said softness in China\'s economy is affecting their business, so it might be worth listening to see if MSFT saw any impact from this, as well.\n\n### Options Activity\n\nAs of Tuesday afternoon, the day before the earnings release, options traders have priced in a 4.2% ($4.34) stock move in either direction around the coming earnings release, according to the Market Maker Move™ indicator on the thinkorswim® platform.\n\nWeekly option activity has concentrated on the call side, notably at the 105, 108 and 110 strikes. Put activity has been higher at the 100 strike. Implied volatility was at the 49th percentile as of Tuesday afternoon. \n\n**Note** : Call options represent the right, but not the obligation, to buy the underlying security at a predetermined price over a set period of time.

Things are running hot, with major indices higher in pre-market trading as investors digest earnings from **Apple Inc.** (NASDAQ:AAPL) and **Boeing Co**  (NYSE:BA). These two behemoths both surprised to the upside, with BA\'s numbers looking especially strong. BA shares rose more than 5% ahead of the opening bell, while AAPL shares climbed 4.6%.\n\nEarlier this week, **Caterpillar Inc** \'s (NYSE:CAT) earnings appeared to raise concerns about the industrials and how they might respond to weakness in China. The good news coming out of AAPL and BA could help mitigate those concerns. That doesn\'t mean they\'ll go away completely, but maybe they\'re not as bad as people thought.\n\nBA\'s report, in particular, might hold hopes for the overall market. The stock is often seen as a proxy for global economic performance, China included. Many companies reporting so far this earnings season have mentioned Chinese economic slowing as a drag, but the BA earnings might suggest that at least some U.S. multinationals can do fine anyway.\n\nMany overseas markets rose earlier Wednesday, while crude continued to inch higher and gold also headed up (see chart below). The Fed comes out with its decision early this afternoon, but futures prices point to essentially no chance of a rate change.\n\n### Apple, Boeing Spread Cheer\n\nAfter what seemed like one piece of bad news after another over the last few months--including lowering its quarterly revenue projection in early January--Apple delivered some positive tidings after Tuesday\'s close. Earnings and revenue for the company\'s fiscal Q1 both came in above third-party consensus expectations, with earnings per share of $4.18 beating analyst estimates by a penny and revenue of $84.3 billion also just above expectations of $84 billion.\n\nIt wasn\'t all rosy, as iPhone revenue came in just under the Street\'s expectations and fell 15% from a year ago. Still, revenue in the closely watched services segment rose 29% year over year. \n\nProbably less than shocking was AAPL\'s weak performance in China last quarter, considering that AAPL had already warned investors about revenue there being worse than it had previously expected. Sales in the Greater China region fell 27%, while Europe and Japan sales also ticked lower. However, sales in the Americas rose 5%, the company said. \n\nDuring its conference call, executives reiterated that two headwinds remain weaker economic conditions in China and people waiting longer to replace their iPhones. Another headwind is dollar strength, AAPL noted.\n\nThese factors might be eating into AAPL\'s guidance. Apple expects revenue of $55 billion to $59 billion for the March quarter, below the average consensus estimate of $59.98 billion, according to FactSet. Analysts expect the number of iPhones sold in the March period will decline at the steepest level in the company\'s history, The Wall Street Journal reported.\n\nIt seems like some of those negatives got shaken off in pre-market trading. It might have helped that AAPL CEO Tim Cook said on the call that he believes there\'s "a bit more optimism in the air" on U.S./China relations, according to media reports. The two countries are entering another round of trade negotiations this week. There also seems to be a sense in the analyst community that maybe some of the worst AAPL news has already been digested, judging from some of the analyst reports out today.\n\nThe news from BA was less checkered. There\'s not much to look at cross-eyed here. Earnings of $5.48 shattered the third-party consensus view of $4.58, while revenue of $28.34 billion also came in well above expectations and was up 14% year over year. Maybe the most important thing to note about BA is that profit margin was up 12% year over year. That is massive, and that might be what people are drawn to right away.\n\nBA also forecast 2019 earnings per share well above analysts\' expectations, and sees record commercial airplane deliveries. That might be read as a sign of continued firm demand for commercial air travel.  It could be interesting to tune into some of BA\'s call with analysts to get executives\' take on the global economy and what\'s driving all this enthusiasm for new airplanes. The company\'s defense business also looked good.\n\n### Up Next: Fed Decision\n\nThe Fed is expected to issue its decision on interest rates at 2 p.m. ET today. Typically, there doesn\'t tend to be a lot of price movement in the major indices on days when the Fed looms. However, with the futures market predicting virtually no chance of a hike, perhaps the pending decision might not be as big a deal as, say, a month ago.\n\nOne thing that could potentially cause some volatility later is Fed Chairman Jerome Powell\'s press conference. Many investors are probably curious to hear what sort of tone Powell might take and whether it will correlate with somewhat dovish statements that both he and other Fed officials have been making since the last Fed meeting. Until this month, the Fed was arguably among the primary sources of volatility in the markets as many investors worried that four rate hikes last year might have rates positioned too high even as the global economy slowed. \n\nNow, with few investors expecting another hike until much later this year, if at all, according to futures prices and surveys (see more below), the Fed has become kind of secondary in many investors\' thinking. That could change, naturally, depending on circumstances and data. Inflation data recently has appeared pretty benign, so it might be interesting to hear what the Fed has to say about possible reasons behind that.\n\nPowell\'s language at the press conference might help investors get a better sense of where he stands not only on future rate action, but also on how the Fed might handle its balance sheet going forward. Media reports since last Friday have hinted that the Fed might slow the runoff of its bond holdings. If that\'s the case, there\'s a chance it could help keep borrowing costs down. There\'s some debate in the analyst community about whether or not the Fed might provide a balance sheet strategy update today.\n\n### Treasury Yields Fall Ahead of Fed\n\nSpeaking of borrowing costs, they fell again Tuesday (see chart) as some investors once again seemed more willing to embrace "defensive" parts of the market. The 10-year yield slipped to 2.7%, down from near 2.8% at its high earlier this month. While the lower yields appeared to weigh on financials, the industrial sector topped the sector leaderboard Tuesday ahead of BA earnings and as investors seemed to appreciate results from **Lockheed Martin Corporation** (NYSE:LMT) and **3M Co**  (NYSE:MMM).\n\nMost major indices fell on Tuesday, though the Dow Jones Industrial Average ($DJI) managed slight gains amid strength in components like **Pfizer Inc.** (NYSE:PFE) and MMM. Earnings reports from both seemed to get some love despite including a few disappointing elements. Lately, it seems like companies are getting forgiven more often than not for guidance or financial misses.\n\nA lot of companies--including MMM and AAPL--have warned investors about a slowdown in China having an impact on their businesses. However, shares of both have been rising.  Could it be that at least some investors are starting to feel that China weakness might already be built into some companies\' stock prices? We\'ll have to wait and see.\n\nMore earnings lie ahead. **Microsoft Corporation**  (NASDAQ:MSFT), **Visa Inc** (NYSE:V), and **Tesla Inc** (NASDAQ:TSLA) are all scheduled to report after the close today. Tomorrow brings **MasterCard Inc** (NYSE:MA), **General Electric Company** (NYSE:GE), and **Amazon.com, Inc.** (NASDAQ:AMZN), among others. Also on tap Thursday: **Ferrari NV** (NYSE:RACE), which might give a sense of how the high rollers are spending their money these days.\n\nThe week doesn\'t get any less hectic when Friday rolls around. We wake up that morning to the January payrolls report (see more below).\n\n**Figure 1: Easing Off:** U.S. 10-Year Treasury yields (candlestick) have eased over the last week heading into today\'s Fed meeting. However, gold (purple line) has shot up to over $1,300 an ounce, which some analysts say might be related to uncertainty over Brexit. Data Source: CME Group, Cboe Global Markets. Chart Source: The thinkorswim® platform from TD Ameritrade. _For illustrative purposes only. Past performance does not guarantee future results._\n\n**Jobs Data Loom Friday** : Amid all the earnings and today\'s Fed meeting conclusion, it\'s also a big week for economic data. Arguably there\'s none more important than Friday\'s January payrolls report, especially since today\'s Q4 gross domestic product (GDP) estimate was delayed by the shutdown (it\'s unclear when that will be ready, but media reports suggest an average third-party estimate for GDP growth of 2.6%). \n\nAnyway, as payrolls approach, we\'re coming off a huge job gain of 312,000 in December, along with average wages rising 3.2% year over year. That wage rise was up from 3.1% the prior month, and might bear watching because continued wage gains--while good news for workers--sometimes spark inflation worries. For January, analysts expect payroll growth to ease back quite a bit from December, to just 160,000 according to a Briefing.com survey. It\'s unclear if the jobs report might reflect any impact from the long government shutdown, but it seems possible. Average hourly earnings are seen rising 0.2% month over month, Briefing.com said, down from 0.4% in the prior report.\n\n**Month on Positive Path** : With just today and tomorrow left in January, the year seems like it\'s off to a relatively strong start for U.S. stocks. That\'s especially the case if you look beyond the big three indices to some of the less closely followed ones, like transports and small caps, that some analysts believe can sometimes tell more about the health of the underlying economy. Going into Wednesday, the Dow Jones Transportation Average ($DJT) was easily outpacing the S&P 500 (SPX), up more than 8% year to date. It had another strong day Tuesday despite a drop in the SPX.  \n\nSo far this quarter, there have been some surprisingly positive earnings and optimism from major airlines. In their earnings calls, none of the airlines have been mentioning any worries about tariffs or crude oil prices. Some rail and shipping companies have also had a good month on the charts, perhaps a sign of U.S. consumers remaining in relatively good health despite the government shutdown.\n\n**Investors Assess Rate Hike Odds for 2019** : A rate hike would seem pretty unlikely today, judging from how the futures market is shaping up, but that doesn\'t necessarily mean we\'re out of the woods for the year. A CNBC survey of investors released Tuesday showed 78% expect at least one rate hike before the end of 2019. In addition, 48% expect a hike next year. However, now there\'s also a column in the survey for possible rate cuts, with 17% of respondents expecting the Fed to ease rates this year and 37% expecting that next year. One thing investors surveyed by CNBC agreed about was today\'s Fed meeting. There are 100% expectations for no rate moves.\n\n_Information from TDA is not intended to be investment advice or construed as a recommendation or endorsement of any particular investment or investment strategy, and is for illustrative purposes only.

The charts below show Amazon\'s largest single-day gains and losses of the past eight years. The dates highlighted by the red boxes indicate trading sessions that occurred within two days of a quarterly earnings report.\n\nHere are some potential takeaways from the information outlined above:\n\n  * Amazon tends to have volatile earnings reactions, and 15 of its 16 most volatile trading sessions of the past eight years were in response to earnings reports.\n  * Amazon stock has typically moved up or down more than 3 percent on the day following Q4 earnings.\n  * Four of Amazon\'s last five earnings reports have generated a positive market reaction, but the lone exception was a massive 7.8 percent post-earnings sell-off last quarter.\n\n\n\nAccording to Optionslam.com, Amazon\'s seven-day implied movement based on the weekly options market is 6.7 percent.\n\nAmazon traded around $1,723.63 per share, up 3.2 percent at time of publication. The stock is up 15 percent year-to-date.\n\nAnalysts appreciated the solid earnings and outlook from **Microsoft Corporation** (NASDAQ:MSFT) and remain bullish on the computing giant, saying it should reach the trillion dollar market cap threshold in 2019.\n\nWedbush analyst Daniel Ives maintained an Outperform rating with a $140 price target on Microsoft. Morgan Stanley analyst Keith Weiss has Microsoft rated Overweight, also with a price target of $140. Both analysts expect the company to hit a trillion-dollar market cap in the coming year.\n\nShares traded down 2 percent at $104.24 Thursday afternoon.\n\n### Results\n\nMicrosoft came in with earnings for the December quarter right around where analysts expected, but the results were reassuring as other industry players showed beginning signs of weakness.\n\nThe big upside for Microsoft was in sales of Azure, the set of cloud services Microsoft sells to businesses, allowing them to keep data remotely in the cloud. Sales of Azure were up 76 percent for the quarter year-over-year, and continued to gain market share at the expense of other players like**Amazon.com Inc.**(NASDAQ:AMZN).\n\n### **Wedbush**\n\nIves said the results were "another feather in the cap" for CEO Satya Nadella and the company\'s quest to become a cloud behemoth.\n\n"We believe the company\'s positive outlook for the March quarter and strong underlying cloud, Office 365/Azure, and enterprise demand trends for 2019 speaks to a company still in the middle innings of a renaissance of growth," Ives wrote in a note. "We are bullish on MSFT into 2019 given our thesis that Azure\'s cloud momentum is still in its early days of playing out."\n\nThe company\'s total commercial cloud computing revenue, including subscriptions to cloud-based Office 365 along with Azure, grew 48 percent.\n\n### Morgan Stanley\n\nWeiss said Microsoft is "strong where it matters," meaning the strong cloud business growth.\n\nBut, Weiss did inject a bit of caution into his note, reminding investors there remains risk, citing weaker results in Microsoft\'s Windows business. Microsoft reported that sales of its Windows operating system were down, blaming the drop in part on a shortage in computer chips.\n\nWeiss moved full-year revenue estimates slightly lower, though he did say full-year revenue should still sustain about 13 percent growth.\n\nBut Weiss agreed strong positioning for public adoption of cloud computing and other strengths do support Microsoft hitting the $1 trillion market cap, with top line drivers including Azure, its continuing addition of data centers and its Office 365 business suite of products.\n\n"With improvement in gross margins, continued (operating expense) discipline and strong capital return, we see a durable teens total return profile at MSFT," Weiss wrote.\n\n_Related Links:_\n\n_Microsoft Reports Slight Q2 Earnings Beat_\n\n_World\'s Largest Company?

A new exchange traded fund provides access to that theme.\n\n### What Happened\n\nThe **Amplify International Online Retail ETF** (NYSE:XBUY) debuted Wednesday, courtesy of Chicago-based Amplify ETFs. Amplify is the purveyor of the **Amplify Online Retail ETF** (NASDAQ:IBUY).\n\nIBUY, which turns three years old in April, is the original ETF dedicated to domestic e-commerce and online retail companies. Home to over $290 million in assets under management, IBUY is not only one of the largest "next gen" retail ETFs, it is one of the biggest retail ETFs of any stripe.\n\n### Why It\'s Important\n\nThe Amplify International Online Retail ETF tracks the EQM International Ecommerce Index, which is provided by the same sponsor of IBUY\'s underlying index.\n\nXBUY\'s index "seeks to measure the performance of equity securities issued by non-U.S. companies that derive at least 90% of their revenue from online business transactions or e-commerce platforms," according to Amplify.\n\nThe new ETF holds 45 stocks, none of which exceed weights of 3.24 percent. At the geographic level, 13 countries are represented in XBUY, including four emerging markets, but China and Japan combine for over 51 percent of the new fund\'s geographic exposure.\n\n"Many of the fastest growing e-commerce markets reside outside of the U.S., primarily in developing countries where mobile devices are stoking demand," said Christian Magoon, CEO of Amplify ETFs, in a statement. "XBUY presents a compelling opportunity for investors to capitalize on this international growth, a segment where 80% of total online retail sales in 2018 were from countries outside the U.S."\n\n### What\'s Next\n\nXBUY is not dependent on large- and mega-cap stocks as 81 percent of the new ETF\'s components are mid- and small-cap names. Over half the new ETF\'s are traditional retailers while a combined 48 percent are marketplace providers and travel sites.\n\nXBUY\'s annual fee is 0.69 percent, or $69 on a $10,000 investment. Familiar names in the new fund included **Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.** (NYSE:BABA) and **JD.com Inc.**(NASDAQ:JD).\n\n_Related Links:_\n\n_AdvisorShares Eyes Marijuana ETF Listing_\n\n_Reversals Work In This ETF_\n\nA day after the Fed left rates unchanged and indicated a pause, investors sat down to their Thursday breakfasts looking at a hefty helping of fresh earnings reports. \n\nThe results from the latest earnings tidal wave seem relatively mixed, and perhaps that\'s reflected in the mixed tone of pre-market trading. There might be a bit of a dichotomy in the major indices, at least judging from how things went ahead of the opening bell. The Nasdaq (COMP) rose slightly, perhaps helped by a pre-market jump in **Facebook**(NASDAQ:FB) shares following that company\'s solid earnings report, while the S&P 500 (SPX) felt some pressure.\n\nWe\'ll get to more earnings stuff in just a bit, but first a quick backward glance at what the central bank had to say.\n\nThe Fed didn\'t just leave rates alone. It also removed the words, "further gradual increases" from its statement. The subtraction of that phrase and Fed Chair Jerome Powell\'s post-meeting press conference might have helped convince investors that the Fed is serious about being patient, another word that appeared in the statement. \n\nOverall, Powell and company look a lot more dovish than they did after their meeting in December. Markets reacted with a new burst of rally speed late Wednesday, but by Thursday morning some of the excitement appeared to dissipate a bit. The mixed tone in U.S. markets followed strength in Asia and a checkered performance out of Europe overnight. \n\n### Earnings Deluge Rolls Along\n\nA slew of earnings reports hit the market between yesterday\'s closing bell and this morning. There doesn\'t seem to be any single takeaway to describe them. Some of the major reporting companies achieved more than expected while others came up short. \n\nIf there\'s a standout on the positive side, it\'s arguably FB. Shares surged nearly 12% in pre-market trading after the company easily beat third-party consensus earnings and revenue expectations. FB said daily active user growth climbed 9% in the quarter to 1.52 billion, while monthly active user growth also rose 9%. From a less bullish angle, the company did say it expects revenue growth to slow. However, revenue rose at about a 30% clip in Q4, beating the company\'s own guidance range.\n\nThe thing investors might want to consider with FB is how it follows up these positive numbers. It\'s a great story and many investors had left it for dead three months ago. On the other hand, we\'ve seen good earnings from FB in the past followed by trouble.\n\nAs FB shares shot higher, **Microsoft Corporation** (NASDAQ:MSFT) sagged slightly after the company missed analysts\' revenue estimates. Revenue of $32.47 billion compared with the third-party consensus of $32.49 billion. It wasn\'t necessarily all a disappointment, however, as MSFT beat the consensus earnings per share estimate by a penny and saw cloud computing revenue rise 20%. Also, its closely watched Azure cloud-computing platform had a second straight quarter of 76% growth.\n\nShares of **Tesla Inc** (NASDAQ:TSLA) joined MSFT in the red zone early Thursday after the company reported earnings per share that fell well short of the Street\'s average estimate. Shares were down about 4% in pre-market trading.\n\nOther major earnings reports in the spotlight today include **DowDupont Inc  **(NYSE:DWDP) and **General Electric Company** (NYSE:GE). Shares of GE rose. Also, after the closing bell we\'ll hear from **Amazon.com, Inc.  **(NASDAQ:AMZN). One thing to consider looking at with AMZN, beyond their core business, is the performance of Amazon Web Services (AWS), the company\'s cloud-computing platform. Get your pencils and scorecards ready.\n\n### A "Solid," Not "Strong" Economy, Fed Says\n\nIn its statement yesterday, the Fed called U.S. economic activity, "solid," a change from "strong" in the December statement. That might speak to the Fed detecting signs of slowing in the economy. It noted that its inflation gauges "have moved lower in recent months."\n\nHow do you define "solid" vs. "strong?" One thought is that solid means more consistent, but strong means, "we\'re really rolling along." If strong is equivalent to a "five-star" rating, maybe solid is four stars.\n\nThe Fed said the labor market "continues to strengthen" and that "job gains have been strong, on average." Household spending, it said, "has continued to grow strongly.". This all appeared to support contentions that the U.S. economy is still in good shape.\n\nFor those still worried about prices rising, perhaps they\'ll be soothed by the Fed saying that inflation pressures appear "muted." Tomorrow\'s wage number in the payrolls report could still get a close look, however, for signs of any inflation pick-up.\n\nYesterday\'s rate decision probably wasn\'t much of a surprise to most investors, considering the futures market had pegged chances of a hike at just 1% going into the meeting. Fed Chair Powell and other Fed officials telegraphed pretty convincingly over the last month that a pause might be in order, and not just for this one meeting, either. \n\nInvestors who got used to the Fed raising rates every quarter in 2018 might have to adjust to a little less excitement. Some analysts are comparing this to the "pause" of 2016, when the Fed waited an entire year to raise rates after doing so in December 2015. It was seen at the time as sort of a test of how the economy would react to a slight tightening after years of rates being essentially zero.\n\n### The Two Ps: Pause and Patience\n\nAfter the December Fed meeting, the central bank\'s language started to change toward a more dovish tone. Most Fed speakers over the last month seem to be reading from the same hymnal, and the operative words arguably have been "pause" and "patience." Those were some of the takeaways from speeches earlier in January by Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas President Robert Kaplan and Kansas City Fed President Esther George. According to Kaplan, it would be "wise to be patient" for the Fed, he told reporters. He said the Fed should be thinking in terms of "months, not weeks."\n\nAfter yesterday\'s Fed announcement, futures prices indicated chances for another hike at 1% for the March meeting, and less than 5% for the June meeting. The market pegs odds of rates rising before the end of 2019 at just around 4%. That\'s quite a change from where things were a few months ago, when many investors appeared to expect two rate hikes this year. Another thing that might be worth noting: The market now projects nearly 12% chances of the Fed lowering rates by 25 basis points between now and the end of the year.\n\nIn his press conference immediately after the decision, Powell said the case for raising rates has "weakened." He added that monetary policy is "appropriate" and in the range of the Federal Open Market Committee\'s (FOMC) estimates of neutral. That would mean rates at a level that neither would spark additional economic activity nor suppress growth.\n\nThe Fed\'s recent more dovish vibe seemed to calm down the market a bit after the interest rate scare last fall when the 10-year Treasury yield jumped above 3.2%. By early Thursday, it had fallen to 2.67% as worries about rate hikes ebbed. Market volatility has also eased over the last few weeks. The VIX--the market\'s most influential "fear indicator"--fell below 18 early Thursday after topping 30 a month ago. It hasn\'t gone much below 17 in recent months, so the question might be whether it can sustain these low levels considering all the geopolitical tension. \n\nSpeaking of geopolitics, there were media reports early Thursday about the possibility of another meeting between the leaders of China and the U.S. Their deadline for a trade deal is just a month away, with talks now taking place. There are also talks going on at the U.S. Capitol as legislators face just about two weeks to come up with a deal to keep the government open. \n\nAcross the Atlantic, Brexit remains front and center. The deadline there is toward the end of March, and some media outlets are talking about increased odds of a "No Deal" Brexit. British businesses are stockpiling products and delaying new investments, The New York Times said today. Could that have negative long-term implications for the European economy? Only time will tell.\n\n**FIGURE 1: SEAS OF RED AND GREEN:**  After bottoming out in late December, the S&P 500 Index (SPX - candlestick) began its march higher through the January Fed meeting.

When one rises, the other tends to fall. Well, gold has been on a tear since last September, but the dollar shows no signs of packing it in. This could reflect all the geopolitical balls in the air that appear to be driving some investors toward what they might see as "safer" investments, though no investment is ever truly safe. There\'s Brexit, U.S./China trade negotiations, a deadline in mid-February for another potential U.S. government shutdown, and turmoil in oil-producing Venezuela. Typically, uncertainty tends to support gold prices. Since the end of September, gold is up about 10%, reaching $1,310 an ounce early Wednesday compared with below $1,200 back then.  \n\nOver that same period, the U.S. Dollar Index ($DXY) is essentially unchanged, still trading between 95 and 96. Brexit\'s potential impact on the pound might be a factor supporting the dollar despite gold market strength. One thing to consider watching, however, is central bank policy. The Fed and other major central banks are sounding more dovish, so we\'ll have to wait and see if that starts to weigh more on the dollar, as looser monetary policy sometimes does.\n\n**Fed Lacks 20/20 Vision This Time** : The Fed came to its decision today lacking information it normally would have. That\'s because the government shutdown, which ended last week, prevented release of some key data. These include Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and December personal income and outlays, as well as a December trade report. The Fed typically keeps a close eye on these numbers, so in effect, it was flying slightly blind this time out. \n\nWhen Q1 GDP ultimately comes out this spring, it might be interesting to see if it reflects any impact from the shutdown. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) said this week that the shutdown cost the economy $11 billion, including a permanent $3 billion loss. The CBO also projected economic growth will slow this year to 2.3%, compared with 3.1% last year, as benefits of the new tax law begin to fade. \n\n**A Look Across the Pond** : As investors ponder the next possible move by the Fed, some might look to Europe for some additional insight. Earlier this month the rate on the German 10-yr Bund sank to its lowest level in nearly two years, and as of today sits at a mere 0.188%. Recall that the German benchmark interest rate spent a chunk of 2016 on the negative side.\n\nThough the European Central Bank (ECB) recently announced a phase-out of its $2.9 trillion bond-buying program, this week ECB President Mario Draghi said the central bank "stands ready to adjust all of its instruments, as appropriate, to ensure that inflation continues to move towards the governing council\'s inflation aim." With the latest eurozone inflation reading clocking in at a less-than-robust 1.6%, and with the ECB having just pushed its next expected rate hike out to mid-2020 (from late 2019), it seems the "pause-and-patience" approach is occurring on both sides of the Atlantic.\n\n_Information from TDA is not intended to be investment advice or construed as a recommendation or endorsement of any particular investment or investment strategy, and is for illustrative purposes only.

As previously noted in this space, bad years for KWEB are often followed by rebounds. The China Internet ETF is obliging with a year-to-date gain of 13.68 percent.\n\nThere are some risks facing the BATs this year.\n\n"Rising competition, M&A, trade tensions, and heightened regulatory risk are the main questions put to Fitch Ratings by credit investors in the Chinese internet majors," said Fitch Ratings in a note out earlier this week.\n\n**Why It \'s Important **\n\nIn order, Tencent, Alibaba and Baidu combine for 26.45 percent of KWEB\'s roster, according to KraneShares data. With a market value of $423.33 billion, Alibaba is about the same size as Facebook and almost triple the size of Netflix.\n\nThere are synergies between the BATs and other Chinese Internet companies. For instance, **iQiyi Inc.** (NASDAQ:IQ), often compared to Netflix, has partnership with Baidu.\n\n"iQiyi also utilizes Baidu\'s world-class artificial intelligence (AI) research to improve the efficiency of its operations," notes KraneShares.\n\niQiyi, shares of which are up more than 30 percent in the U.S. this year, is KWEB\'s 12th-largest holding.\n\n**What \'s Next **\n\n"These companies (the BATs) are driving internet revolution beyond their core internet services to an era of artificial intelligence (AI) technology, amongst others," said Fitch. "Fitch Ratings believes that M&A will remain opportunistic and regulatory risk will stay manageable. We consider the direct exposure of US tariffs to be minimal for these companies, though weaker consumer spending may indirectly dampen growth prospects."\n\n_Related Links:_\n\n_Gold Vs.
