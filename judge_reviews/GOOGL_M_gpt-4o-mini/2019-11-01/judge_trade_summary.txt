News Factors Considered:
['Benzinga is highlighting nominees for the fifth annual Benzinga Global Fintech Awards ahead of the event Nov. 19 in New York City.\n\nOne nominee is Veem, a payment fintech servicing global commerce.\n\n### Background\n\nLaunched in 2014, the San Francisco-based fintech offers local currency transfers to small businesses.\n\nVeem converts sender\'s funds into bitcoin, selling the currency at an exchange for the desired currency of the recipient.\n\nThe firm leverages blockchain as a means to facilitate transactions. In doing so, the need for intermediaries -- like banks -- is eliminated, reducing costs for small- and medium-sized businesses.\n\n### Recent Developments\n\nVeem increased its cost-effective secure transfer coverage to more than 95 countries with the extension of its platform to Canada. \n\n"Veem has two priorities -- provide safe, secure transactions and expand into markets to better serve businesses regardless of size. At Veem, all customers are treated as enterprise customers, receiving the immediate, individualized attention banks often fail to provide," CEO Marwan Forzley said in in a press release.\n\nThe expansion allows Canadian users to execute transfers on the Veem multicurrency transaction platform, which shows real-time currency and transaction identification information.\n\nAdditionally, Veem announced its integration with Zapier, allowing businesses and contractors the ability to make payments with over 1,500 applications including **salesforce.com, inc.** (NYSE:CRM) and **Alphabet Inc**(NASDAQ:GOOGL) (NASDAQ:GOOG)\'s GSuite.\n\nHeather Satterly of Satterly Training & Consulting LLC described the platform as "fantastic" in a press release.\n\n"Now, it doesn\'t matter what accounting system my client is using, I can build an automation so they can use Veem. Plus, I can now customize any notification emails that are sent to my customers."\n\n### Going Forward\n\nVeem aims to address major pain points in the global payments commerce space.\n\nIts introduction of programs like the Veem Tariff Relief program, which reimburses businesses disrupted by the ongoing trade war, protects businesses within its network, increasing the sustainability of its payments operations, according to the company. \n\nCEO Forzley said the Benzinga Global Fintech Awards are some of the most prestigious in the space. \n\n"Veem\'s nomination in the Best Use of Blockchain category is proof that the work we\'re doing in the global payments sector is changing the way businesses pay, get paid and build new relationships."\n\nVisit bzawards.com to learn more about this fintech and many others like it.\n\n_Related Links:  _\n\n_Modulus, A Provider Of High-Performance Trading Tech, Takes On Digital Assets_\n\n_Hydrogen Partners With TD, Oracle To Develop Simplified Digital Financial Solutions_\n\n**Netflix Inc** (NASDAQ:NFLX)\'s inclusion in the prestigious "FAANG" acronym should come to an end, with its replacement being the "far less episodic" **Microsoft Corporation** (NASDAQ:MSFT), CNBC\'s Jim Cramer said during Friday\'s "Mad Money."\n\nNetflix reported a miss on "almost every key metric" in its recent third-quarter report, Cramer said. \n\nAmong the more concerning readouts: Netflix\'s subscriber growth, which fell short of expectations for the second straight quarter, the CNBC host said.\n\nNetflix\'s stock has "lost its mojo," and with the stock trading near $275 per share, there is more downside to be seen, he said. \n\n### Why It\'s Important\n\nAmong the other stocks in the FAANG group, Cramer said social media company **Facebook, Inc.** (NASDAQ:FB) is "very undervalued" and belongs in the group of elite stocks so long as the U.S. government doesn\'t dictate that the company has to spin off Instagram or WhatsApp.\n\nOn the other hand, **Alphabet Inc** (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) could benefit from being forced to split its search, cloud and self-driving businesses into separate entities, he said. \n\n**Apple Inc.** (NASDAQ:AAPL) remains a strong stock, backed by the momentum of its new iPhone, Cramer said. Finally, concerns related to **Amazon.com, Inc.** (NASDAQ:AMZN)\'s high levels of investment remain, he said. \n\n### What\'s Next\n\nWhile Netflix\'s stock is trading within striking distance of where it opened to start 2019, Microsoft\'s stock values the company at around $1.06 trillion, or roughly 40% higher than when it started the year, Cramer said.\n\nReplacing Netflix with Microsoft in an elite stock group may be the easy decision, and creating a new acronym will be the "difficult" choice to make, he said. \n\nNetflix shares were down 0.22% at $274.70 at the time of publication Monday, while Microsoft shares were up 0.28% at $137.79. \n\n_Related Links:_\n\n_As Trade Talks Approach,"Barometer" Stocks Like Apple And Boeing Could Be In Focus_\n\n_Apple, Microsoft And Semiconductors: Technology Sector Earnings Ahead_'
 'Trader and mentor Danielle Shay recently spoke with Benzinga about her mission of encouraging people to get involved in the markets regardless of their background.\n\n### About Danielle Shay\n\nShay comes from an international law and human rights background. Her free-spirited demeanor and desire to help people motivated her pursuit of humanitarian missions, she told Benzinga. \n\n"In college, I went to Costa Rica and did a ton of volunteer work, teaching English and anti-drug classes [and] coaching kids sports."\n\nShay told Benzinga she returned to the U.S. after becoming pregnant; her initial plan of going to law school and teaching became unrealistic.\n\nDistraught and in need of income, Shay\'s father got involved.\n\n"He suggested that I trade options because I could do it from anywhere," she said. "I wanted something that would enable me to make enough money to take care of my son, and so teaching was pretty much out of the question."\n\n_See Also:How This Successful Trader Used A Background In Languages To Break Into The Options Market_\n\n### Learn And Test\n\nShay took an introductory class and became intrigued.\n\n"I joined a trading room at Simpler Trading, which is where I now work."\n\nShe said she learned quickly, attending daily webinars and paper trading to figure out what strategies were most fitting.\n\n"I used that [paper] account to figure out how options strategies work: how to get in and how to get out. Initially, I followed along with the trades posted in the trading room. Then, over time, I was able to figure out what my style was."\n\n### Patience Is Key\n\n"It\'s really hard to learn when you have a full-time job," Shay said.\n\nShe stressed the importance of patience. After practicing for a long duration, she began scaling her positions.\n\n"I was getting a bit more aggressive. I started off with put credit spreads and then added some long calls."\n\nHer trading became profitable, and she began making more money from it than she did from her work as a part-time photgrapher.\n\n"I just remember waking up realizing that I made more money on two trades than in my entire month\'s salary as a photographer. That was the moment I decided that this is what I\'m going to do."\n\nShay is now director of options at Simpler Trading. She frequently appears on Vox, Cheddar, Yahoo Finance and CNBC, helping demystify the market with her insightful commentary.\n\nShe\'s writing a book on trading, highlighting her experiences, failures, successes and steps that need to be taken to find profits in the market.\n\n### A Strategy Evolution\n\nAt the outset, Shay traded long options directionally on a two-day to three-week time frame.\n\n"I identified dips on the strong directional charts, buying those dips on tickers waiting to break out of consolidation," she said.\n\nNow that Shay has more experience, she trades a multitude of different strategies.\n\n"I do reversion to the mean, trend following, earnings reports -- both the actual report, the pre-earnings report, as well as post earnings. I trade a variety of strategies. I use calls, puts, spreads, butterflies [and] unbalanced butterflies."\n\n### Bread-And-Butter Setup\n\nOne of Shay\'s go-to setups is a play on relative strength within the marketplace.\n\n"I start off with the indexes; I look at the S&P, the Russell, the Nasdaq, the Dow. I\'m comparing the strength of the trend and I\'m also looking for consolidation for possible breakouts," she told Benzinga. \n\n"Once I identify the strongest index, I\'ll go down within that index and look for relative strength names to trade within it."\n\nFor example, if Shay decides the Nasdaq Composite is strong, she focuses on names within that index, such as **Apple Inc.** (NASDAQ:AAPL), **Microsoft Corporation** (NASDAQ:MSFT) and **Alphabet Inc** (NASDAQ:GOOGL) (NASDAQ:GOOG), trading options on securities that have attractive technical chart patterns and fundamentals that show prosperity, like earnings growth.\n\n### For The Newbies\n\nShay stressed the importance of risk aversion.\n\n"In the beginning, you\'re not going to make money. I think it\'s important to understand that. I did the losing money portion when I was paper trading."\n\nTrying different strategies is part of the process, but focus is essential, she said.\n\n"In the beginning, you\'re not going to know what works for you. I trained under John Carter, so I love directional long calls, aggressive-type movements. There\'s a lot of people who would prefer selling premium out of the money. The unfortunate thing about it is, you don\'t know what you love until you try a couple of different things."\n\nOnce traders find a strategy or niche of interest, they must master it, Shay said.\n\n"One of the biggest problems I see with people is they just jump from strategy to strategy, mentor to mentor. That\'s how you end up losing all your money; it\'s death by a thousand cuts."\n\n_You can get in touch with Shay on Twitter@traderDanielle, as well as at fivestartrader.com._\n\n_Shay took part in the  Traders4ACause conference Oct. 11-13 in Las Vegas._'
 '**Alphabet Inc**(NASDAQ:GOOG)(NASDAQ:GOOGL) shares are moving lower after reporting a third-quarter earnings miss.\n\nThird-quarter earnings came in at $10.12, which may not compare to the $12.38 estimate. Sales came in at $40.499 billion, beating estimates by $179 million.\n\n"I am extremely pleased with the progress we made across the board in the third quarter, from our recent advancements in search and quantum computing to our strong revenue growth driven by mobile search, YouTube and Cloud," CEO Sundar Pichai said. "We\'re focused on providing the most helpful services to our users and partners, and we see many opportunities ahead."\n\n_See Also:Report Says Google Looking To Acquire Fitbit_\n\n### Highlights\n\n  * Revenues increased 21% year-over-year\n  * Operating margin was 26%\n\n\n\nGOOG shares traded down 3.3% in Monday\'s after-hours session. The stock closed the regular session at $1,290 per share.\n\n**Alphabet Inc \'s** (NASDAQ:GOOG)(NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google has made an offer to acquire **Fitbit Inc**(NYSE:FIT), according to Reuters.\n\nFitbit supplies fitness trackers and smartwatches. Reuters said there is no certainty the negotiations between Alphabet and Fitbit will lead to a deal, and the exact price Google has offered for Fitbit was undisclosed.\n\nFitbit\'s stock spiked higher by 28% to $5.58 per share following the report.

Benzinga\'s outlook for Alphabet is included in the following report.\n\n### Earnings and Revenue\n\nAlphabet earnings will be near $12.38 per share on sales of $40.32 billion, according to analysts.\n\nIn the same quarter last year, Alphabet posted a profit of $13.06 on sales of $33.74 billion. If the company were to report inline earnings when it publishes results Monday, earnings would be down 5.21%. Sales would be have grown 19.50% from the same quarter last year. The company\'s reported EPS has stacked up against analyst estimates in the past like this:\n\n \n\n**Quarter** | **Q2 2019** | **Q1 2019** | **Q4 2018** | **Q3 2018**  \n---|---|---|---|---  \n**EPS Estimate** | 11.300 | 10.580 | 10.86 | 10.46  \n**EPS Actual** | 14.210 | 11.900 | 12.77 | 13.06  \n  \n### Stock Performance\n\nFor a full 12 months, the return has risen by 19.11%. Given that these returns are generally positive, long-term shareholders are probably relaxed going into this earnings release. Long-term shareholders are already enjoying 12-month gains prior to the announcement.\n\nAnalysts have adjusted their estimates lower for EPS and revenues over the past 90 days. Analysts have been rating Alphabet stock as Neutral. The strength of this rating has maintained conviction over the past three months.\n\n### Conference Call\n\nAlphabet is scheduled to hold a conference call at 5:00 p.m. ET and can be accessed here: https://www.youtube.com/user/GoogleIR/featured'
 '**Sony Corp**(NYSE:SNE) announced Tuesday in a blog post it would be shutting down its live TV streaming service PlayStation Vue.\n\nThe service will be discontinued on Jan. 30, 2020.\n\nPlayStation Vue, which was launched in 2015, offered users the ability to watch live TV, like sports, through a paid subscription service. It was supported across a range of devices from **Google** (NYSE:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Chromecastto **Roku** (NASDAQ:ROKU) to**Amazon.com** (NASDAQ:AMZN) Fire devices.\n\nSony reasoned that "the competitive Pay TV industry, with expensive content and network deals, has been slower to change than we expected."\n\n_Related Links:_\n\n_Analyst: Verizon Partnership Is Great News For Disney, Bad News For Netflix_\n\n_When He \'s 64: What\'s Bill Gates Up To These Days?_\n\nOn CNBC\'s "Fast Money Final Trade," Tim Seymour said **iShares MSCI Emerging Markets Index** (NYSE:EEM) is finally breaking out on the upside.

"This JEDI contract simply confirms it."\n\n### What\'s Next\n\nAmazon\'s loss to rival Microsoft signals it "won\'t be able to monopolize" all of the government\'s cloud-related needs, Cramer said.\n\nSmaller cloud players like Microsoft, **IBM**(NYSE:IBM) and **Alphabet Inc** (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) "have more of a chance to win business," he said. \n\n"As for Amazon, losing this business is no skin off their back," Cramer concluded.\n\n"The real issue is that they\'ve spent so heavily to grow the business, and while I\'m OK with that, it might give you more opportunities to buy the stock into weakness down the road because of Wall Street\'s inherent shortsightedness."\n\nAmazon shares were down 1.05% at the time of publication, while Microsoft shares were falling by 0.6%. \n\n_Related Links:_\n\n_Report: Amazon Could Challenge Microsoft\'s Pentagon Contract Award_\n\n_Cloud Competitors: How Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure\'s Quarterly Performance Stacks Up_\n\n_Photo byCoolcaesar via Wikimedia. _\n\nFor much of the 20th century, changes to the financial services industry could be measured in geologic time. This all changed with the rise of fintech, which massively accelerated the rate of growth across financial services and changed everything from the way we invest, to the products we invest in.\n\nHowever, according to Mike Durbin, president of Fidelity Institutional, that change is far from complete. Speaking at the at the 2019 eMoney Summit in Austin, a three-day gathering of over 1,300 professionals, Durbin outlined four key trends that are taking shape right now in financial services.\n\n### Trend 1: The Rise Of The "Super Platform"\n\nDurbin noted that seven of the 10 most valuable companies in the world have morphed into platform companies, with whole ecosystems of products that supplement and build off one another. And just like **Amazon.com Inc** (NASDAQ:AMZN), **Apple Inc** (NASDAQ:AAPL), **Microsoft Corporation**(NASDAQ:MSFT), and **Alphabet Inc**(NASDAQ:GOOGL) (NASDAQ:GOOG) continuously launch products and services meant to undercut each other, the same is happening in fintech. In this way, Durbin said, the financial services industry is mimicking the technology industry.\n\n"Key players in the wealth and investment management industry are positioning themselves as platform businesses, really one-stop shops for customers," Durbin said. "What\'s fascinating, and I think pretty well-acknowledged in our space, is that everyone\'s technology roadmap is beginning to look eerily similar to each other. We all want to build that super platform.\n\n"You can look at FIS, SS&C, Envestnet, **salesforce.com, inc.** (NYSE:CRM), or even Fidelity for that matter. We all come at it from a different root offering but we\'re all aspiring to deliver a similar vision.\n\n_Image courtesy of Fidelity_\n\n### Trend 2: Product Rationalization And Personalization\n\nThe sheer variety of investment vehicles has exploded in the past 20 years. Where previous generations of investors had limited investment choices, today\'s investors have access to a wider range of solutions, such as hedge funds, separately managed accounts, and wrap accounts.\n\n"After introducing so much choice and complexity to the industry however, we\'re starting to see a pretty good amount of product rationalization and substitution underway," said Durbin.\n\nDurbin cited ETFs as an example of this trend. Not only are ETFs launching and closing at the same rate, but 80% of ETF assets are held in only 600 products provided by the top three providers: **BlackRock Inc**(NYSE:BLK), Vanguard and **State Street Corp** (NYSE:STT).\n\n"That means the remaining 20% of assets are in over 1,600 products from the other 100 providers," he said.\n\nDurbin said this rationalization corresponds with a growth in managed accounts--fee-based products that are more customizable than traditional investment products. Managed accounts at Fidelity have grown by 100% in the last five years. In response, the company recently announced the Fidelity Managed Account Xchange (FMAX), a managed account platform for advisors that will launch in 2020.\n\n"For much of our business, the future is in managed accounts and this more packaged product. And we\'re finding more advisors are interested in outsourcing investment management. Many others are still committed to building portfolios, but in between, there are advisors who want to leverage models."\n\n### Trend 3: The Role Of Capital Is Changing\n\nAccording to Durbin, there are more than 50 private equity firms that are invested in the wealth and investment management space. Venture capital, the cousin of private equity, is expected to hit another record this year for deal size in financial services (Durbin said he expects more than $11 billion of VC investment fintech in 2019, with the average deal size 50% larger in the last 10 years).\n\n"Growth capital allows these fintech firms that we\'re all competing with in one way or another to worry less about that near-term profitability and instead focus on creating really fantastic products and acquiring clients," he said.\n\nBut the inflow of private capital comes at a cost. "Outside capital can put you and a firm on someone else\'s timeline," said Durbin. "It can introduce outside influence that may not be 100% consistent with your firm or your individual purpose and values. Different capital providers have different things on their mind. The magic formula is one that allows for maintaining independence of thought and culture while allowing the capital to support growth."\n\n### Trend 4: There\'s A Turf War\n\nThanks in part to the rise of fintechs, financial services firms are having to grow out of their lanes into other products and services in an attempt to reach the mass market of U.S. investors.\n\n"The more advice that we can deliver into this marketplace, the better things are going to be long term," he said. "However, it probably does mean as more firms go to get out of their lane, we\'re going to be bumping into each other as providers as we sort of extend and more deeply penetrate markets and market segments."\n\nThis means that giant incumbents like Fidelity are now competing with much smaller firms.\n\n"So we may have large firms like Fidelity, or small firms like fintechs and other myriad wealth management providers in between, that are all going after these next-generation investors," said Durbin. "And that can create a little bit of friction in the near term, but we think that the more choice over time, the better it is longer term. Investors are going to select their providers based on a range of factors, and ultimately may different models will win."\n\nAlthough Durbin believes these trends are at play right now, he also cautions that this is still a new industry. As a result, there\'s a strong likelihood they get replaced by new trends down the road.\n\n"These four trends are not static. These are four megatrends we\'re watching now. One, three, five years from now we\'ll probably be talking about other megatrends."\n\n_Photo courtesy of eMoney_\n\n_eMoney is a content partner of Benzinga_\n\n**Alphabet Inc** (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) shares dipped 2% on Tuesday after the company\'s third-quarter earnings report fell short of Wall Street expectations.\n\nGoogle\'s parent company reported third-quarter EPS of $10.12, below consensus estimates of $12.42. Revenue of $40.5 billion and traffic acquisition costs of $7.49 billion were roughly in-line with estimates.\n\nSeveral Wall Street analysts have weighed in on Alphabet stock since the earnings report. Here\'s a sampling of what they\'ve had to say.\n\n### Business As Usual\n\nKeyBanc analyst Andy Hargreaves said revenue growth was solid, but operating expenses weighed on profitability.\n\n"3Q results showed excellent core Sites ad revenue and continued strong growth in GCP, which, along with other significant growth opportunities, suggests the potential for sustained strong revenue and profit growth for the foreseeable future," Hargreaves wrote in a note.\n\nMorgan Stanley analyst Brian Nowak said the quarter was another demonstration of Alphabet\'s "staple-like" ecosystem.\n\n"GOOGL\'s 3Q results - 21% Y/Y ex-FX websites growth in line with us and $9.7bn of GAAP EBIT (excluding a $554mn legal charge we hadn\'t modelled) 3% higher than expected - showcase the continued durability of GOOGL\'s top-line even through laws of large numbers," Nowak wrote.\n\nNomura Instinet analyst Mark Kelley said the quarter was mixed, but Alphabet didn\'t report anything out of the ordinary.\n\n"We view this quarter as business as usual, and with several new and under-monetized products (Maps, Shopping and Feed) able to contribute over the long term, we remain positive," Kelley wrote.\n\n### Firing On All Cylinders\n\nRaymond James analyst Aaron Kessler said Google continued its momentum in cloud, mobile and YouTube in the third quarter.\n\n"GAAP operating income of $9.2B was 2.1/2.6% below our/Street estimate of $9.4B/$9.4B due to higher legal costs (excluding this, operating would have beaten street by ~3%)," Kessler wrote.\n\nWells Fargo analyst Brian Fitzgerald said that despite the EPS miss, Alphabet still offers investors 20% revenue growth at a relatively low multiple and exposure to potential long-term Other Bets catalysts.\n\n"While not sensational, we view 3Q performance as confirming the solid momentum re-established in 2Q," Fitzgerald wrote.\n\nBank of America analyst Justin Post said Google made some impressive progress on key technology in the quarter, and the numbers would have looked a lot better if not for one-time items.\n\n"On the call, Google\'s CEO indicated that Google developed new neural network-based technique for natural language processing could be the biggest advance for search in five years, and a major Quantum Computing milestone, which is pretty unusual for an earnings call and potentially bullish," Post said.\n\n### Ratings And Price Targets\n\n  * Wells Fargo has an Outperform rating and $1,400 target.\n  * Morgan Stanley has an Overweight rating and $1,450 target.\n  * Nomura Instinet has a Buy rating and $1,560 target.\n  * Bank of America has a Buy rating and $1,450 target.\n  * Raymond James has an Outperform rating and a $1,465 target.\n  * KeyBanc has an Overweight rating and $1,546 target.\n\n\n\nGOOGL shares traded around $1,265.41 at time of publication.\n\n### Benzinga\'s Take\n\nThe numbers may not have been as good as Alphabet bulls had hoped, but they certainly weren\'t bad enough to impact the long-term thesis for the stock. Wall Street analysts remain bullish on Google virtually across the board.\n\n_Do you agree with this take?

Under Alphabet\'s umbrella, Fitbit would provide three benefits, including:\n\n  * Valuable IP in wearables;\n  * Partnerships with notable health care companies and providers; and\n  * Data collected from 27 million devices that can be further developed.\n\n\n\nHuberty said Fitbit plays a role in the domestic $3.5 trillion health care market dominated by tech companies looking to invest to "become the next agent of change." As such, Fitbit would look attractive to a potential buyer, especially one with its own health care partnerships in place that can be leveraged to increase monetization.\n\nFitbit\'s stock appreciation on Monday values the stock at around 0.5 times EV/2020 revenue, which is consistent with a two-year trailing average. For the time being, the research firm is sticking with its $3.20 price target which factors in expectations for continued cash burn, lower growth and margins versus its consumer electronics peers.\n\n### Price Action\n\nShares of Fitbit were trading higher by 1.4% Tuesday at $5.68.\n\n_Related Links:_\n\n_Fitbit Pulls Out Of China To Escape Tariffs_\n\n_Analysts: If You Want To Get Fit, Don\'t Buy Fitbit Stock_'
 '-Reuters\n\nDespite being a target for investigations, regulatory pressures and all the criticism, **Facebook Inc** (NASDAQ:FB) easily manages to beat estimates for its third quarter, causing its stock to surge 5% in after-hours trading on Wednesday and 3.9% in premarket trade on Thursday. The Silicon-Valley social media network\'s strong results show that the company is persevering despite regulatory and competitive pressures.\n\n### Earnings\n\nThird quarter net income came to $6.09 billion comparing to $5.14 billion in the same quarter one year ago. Revenue literally jumped from $13.73 billion to $17.65 billion, an overall 29% increase. Revenue is mostly made of advertising sales that made 98% of this extraordinary result. About 2.8 billion people use Facebook and its properties each month, namely Instagram, WhatsApp and Messenger. For now, the company\'s earnings have overpowered the critics surrounding the social media pioneer with its CEO using every possible venue to defend his company over the past few months.\n\n### Settlement To Pay Fine Oer Cambridge Analytica\n\nOn Wednesday, the company has agreed to pay a $645,000 penalty imposed by the UK Information Commissioner\'s Office which found that the company failed to safeguard user data that was gathered by Cambridge Analytica, a political data firm. But, it is important to note that Facebook will not admit any liability under the settlement that involves data of as many as 87 million Facebook users. Overall, it is clear that the company has managed to \'shrug-off\' scandals and pursue its growth path forward.\n\n### Competitors\n\nThe social media landscape is shaped by intense efforts of industry peers to gain market share. And even **Snap Inc** \'s (NYSE:SNAP) Snapchat seems to be making a comeback after Facebook started "borrowing" ideas from the platform, as their third quarter of the fiscal year also exceeded profit and growth expectations. With $446 million revenue and 210 million daily active users, no wonder its shares went up more than 150% from last year. Moreover, it is a very appealing platform for targeting younger demographics. The company has a long way to go before reaching profitability, but it\'s doing a good job at cutting loses, along with adding 7 million daily active users during the last quarter and boosting revenue 50% on a year-to-year basis.\n\nBut the truth of the matter is that it is quite challenging to consistently grow, especially with constant new commers fighting to grab attention from users. One such example is Tik Tok, not only one of the most popular social media apps in 2019 but more importantly, one of the fastest growing. It is also one of the most confusing for some as it combines the power of artificial intelligence to "revolutionize the way people consume and receive information." And with more than half a billion monthly users worldwide and nearly 80 million downloads in the U.S. alone, it is more than a worthy competitor. So, despite being a social media pioneer, Facebook has its hands full to keep its engagement rates and enhance the privacy of its members. And **Twitter Inc** \'s****(NYSE:TWTR) recent decision to halt political ads due to the company\'s view that political reach should be \'earned, not bought\' only put more pressure on the Silicon Valley networking giant that is, for now, sticking to its \'democratic\' opinion.\n\n### Outlook\n\nThe business and the community are clearly continuing to grow despite the backlash as Facebook\'s stock is up 44% this year. And the company is a target in so many areas, with FTC investigation in the company\'s practices, a record $5 billion fine for privacy violations and quite a few politicians calling for the company\'s dissolvement. But it seems that all this scrutiny is not doing that much harm to any of the corporate giants, namely **Amazon.com, Inc.** (NASDAQ:AMZN), **Alphabet Inc  **(NASDAQ:GOOGL) and **Apple Inc**(NASDAQ:AAPL) who also just exceeded estimates with its highest Q4 revenue ever due to strong growth in wearables and despite dropping iPhone sales. These companies redefined our everyday lives and they shape the world we see and know today.
