Based on the provided market data and news, predict the LLMâ€™s decision:
News Factors Considered:
['President-elect Donald Trump held a tech summit at the Trump Towers in New York on Wednesday. It was a meeting of the biggest tech leaders in the country to "begin a conversation and partnership in order to spark innovation and create more jobs in the U.S."\n\nThroughout the meeting, Trump discussed a range of issues that impact both American workers and companies. According to Trump\'s website greatagain.gov, the industry leaders in attendance were encouraged by the president-elect\'s open mind and willingness to listen.\n\n"This is truly an amazing group of people," Trump said to kick off a meeting with Silicon Valley\'s top leaders. Trump said he was there to help lead the future of innovation.\n\nAbsent from the meeting was **Twitter Inc**(NASDAQ: TWTR), Trump\'s favorite social media platform, because it was \'too small\' according to sources. The transition team\'s official reasoning was that "the conference table was only so big."\n\nTrump was accompanied by several members of his cabinet, including Paul Ryan, Steve Bannon and Peter Thiel.\n\n### Attendees\n\nThe list of tech leaders was certainly notable, with the world\'s biggest companies in attendance, including:\n\n  * Larry Page, **Alphabet Inc** (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL).\n  * Eric Schmidt, Alphabet.\n  * Jeff Bezos, **Amazon.com, Inc.** (NASDAQ: AMZN).\n  * Tim Cook, **Apple Inc.** (NASDAQ: AAPL).\n  * Chuck Robbins, **Cisco Systems, Inc.** (NASDAQ: CSCO).\n  * Brian Krzanich, **Intel Corporation** (NASDAQ: INTC).\n  * Ginni Rometty, **International Business Machines Corp.** (NYSE: IBM).\n  * Sheryl Sandberg, **Facebook Inc** (NASDAQ: FB).\n  * Satya Nadella, **Microsoft Corporation** (NASDAQ: MSFT).\n  * Safra Catz, **Oracle Corporation** (NYSE: ORCL).\n  * Alex Karp, Palantir.\n  * Elon Musk, **Tesla Motors Inc** (NASDAQ: TSLA).\n\n\n\nJeff Bezos said the meeting was "very productive" and indicated that the incoming administration emphasized innovation was key in creating new jobs.\n\nAt last check, **Technology SPDR (ETF)** (NYSE: XLK) was up 0.37 percent on Thursday, trading at $49.12.\n\nPresident-elect Donald Trump hosted some of the top technology leaders for a summit, and the guest list was a typical "who\'s who" of Silicon Valley with one exception.\n\nNames such as **Apple Inc.** (NASDAQ: AAPL)\'s CEO Tim Cook, **Amazon.com, Inc.** (NASDAQ: AMZN)\'s CEO Jeff Bezos, **Alphabet Inc** (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL)\'s chairman Eric Schmidt and **Tesla Motors Inc** (NASDAQ: TSLA)\'s CEO Elon Musk are among the most visible. There is however one name that many investors aren\'t familiar with: Alex Karp.\n\nKarp runs a private Silicon Valley company called Palantir Technologies, a software developer that received backing from the CIA\'s venture capital arm and has held contracts with other government agencies.\n\nCoincident or not, the relatively unknown company was co-founded by Peter Thiel, the billionaire Silicon Valley investor, Trump supporter and member of his transition team.\n\nAs noted by CNBC, every company that took part in Trump\'s tech summit was valued at more than $100 billion with the exception of Tesla and Palantir which is valued at just $20 billion.\n\n"I don\'t like the way it looks having Karp in that room," Norman Eisen, a former U.S. ambassador to the Czech Republic who worked on President Barack Obama\'s ethics initiatives told CNBC. "Even if it had a much larger market cap or if he were a much bigger personality, it still looks as if [Thiel] is using the transition for personal advancement."\n\nOn the other hand, the argument can also be made that Silicon Valley is small enough for these types of connections to occur at many companies. For example, Thiel was an early backer in **Facebook Inc** (NASDAQ: FB) and the social media empire sent its chief operations officer Sheryl Sandberg to represent the company at the meeting.\n\nThe holiday season is a time to remind ourselves of the need to help those less fortunate. Here are a few ways techies can make a difference in the life of others.\n\n###  Amazon Smile\n\n**Amazon.com, Inc.** (NASDAQ: AMZN) makes it easy for shoppers to donate to charitable organizations. The company operates Amazon Smile, a platform that donates 0.5 percent of the price of an eligible AmazonSmile purchase to eligible charities.\n\nWhen a user shops at smile.amazon.com they will find the exact same product assortment but tens of millions of products will be eligible for donations.\n\nSome of the charitable groups include the American Red Cross, the Nature Conservancy, Operation Smile, ASPCA and Code.org.\n\nA post on Quora asked the community for help in finding alternatives to Amazon Smile. Here is a list of some of the platforms recommended by Jason Grad, founder of Bstow:\n\n  * Bstow: Donate spare change from everyday purchases.\n  * CauseTap: Support causes by downloading apps.\n  * Check-in For Good: check in at retail locations to generate micro-donations.\n\n\n\n###  Google One Today\n\n**Alphabet Inc** (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL)\'s One Today connects a user with a charity of their choice like no other. Users can receive a real-world photo, short story or an explanation of what is being done with their monetary donations.\n\nAs an example of some of the charities users can pick from, New Avenues to Independence puts $10 to use and is able to train one disabled person for an hour on a new job skill.\n\n"The mission of New Avenues to Independence is to provide opportunities for people with disabilities to become more independent and productive members of society by offering quality support services and developing innovative and inclusive programs," the organization explained.\n\n###  Reddit\'s Random Acts Of Christmas\n\nReddit\'s Random Acts of Christmas is a Reddit community where families request assistance for their children during the Christmas holiday season.\n\nReddit user "tramnytz" published a post in which she asked for help in acquiring presents for her three kids. Thanks to the generosity of complete strangers from across the world, the Reddit user will now be able to give some great presents to her three kids.'
 "**Helios and Matheson Analytics Inc**(NASDAQ: HMNY) shares are on a tear.\n\nThe data analytics and data visualization solutions provider, which completed its  merger  with Zone Technologies on November 9, is launching its RedZone map on the **Alphabet Inc 's ** (NASDAQ: GOOGL)  Google Pay Store.\n\nThe RedZone Map is an app that helps in navigation, while also addressing personal safety, as it combines GPS-driven direction with real-time crime data and social listening. In a release, the company claimed that the app broke through the top 5 on its **Apple Inc. 's ** (NASDAQ: AAPL)  App Store debut in late March 2016.\n\nHelios and Matheson stock, which was at anemic sub-$2 levels in the first half of the year, gained traction when it announced its intention to merge with Zone Technologies in June 2016. However, around the completion of its merger, the stock began pulling back. Going by Monday's stock reaction, it looks like the Google Play debut could give a small lift to the sagging stock.\n\nAt time of writing, Helios and Matheson Analytics shares were rallying 16 percent to $4.85 on roughly five times the average volume.\n\nIs FANG just a fad, or is there any inherent value in the stocks making up the acronym? Canaccord Genuity  looked at these stocks in a note issued Sunday following two weeks of investor meetings. The firm concluded that the recent underperformance of the internet group was more due to outperformance of other sectors such as financials and energy and therefore could be treated as a major buying opportunity. \n\nAnalyst Michael Graham offered his views on the individual stocks.\n\n### Facebook: Valuation Reasonable\n\nGraham noted that most find the valuation of **Facebook Inc** (NASDAQ: FB) reasonable. The analyst is of the view that core Facebook and Instagram can carry fundamentals through 2017. The widespread belief is that caution around  adload  can be compensated with pricing and Instagram, the analyst noted. \n\nWhile also noting that initial guidance for expense growth has caused a selloff in the stock in each of the past three years, the analyst said focus on GAAP EPS is a headwind for the stock.\n\n### Amazon: Prime Flywheel And India Hurt Margins\n\nCanaccord believes **Amazon.com, Inc.**(NASDAQ: AMZN)'s Prime Flywheel and India have served to keep margins low for now, with only half of investors concerned about  growth. Tough comps along with multiple price cuts in November at AWS are large concerns, according to the firm. The firm feels the first-quarter guidance will likely be impacted. \n\n### Netflix Valuation Untenable\n\nWhile some view the valuation of **Netflix, Inc.** (NASDAQ: NFLX) untenable, the firm said the stock could see significant downside in the eventuality of any negative news. The firm is bullish on the stock long term, but believes the first-quarter guidance could be overly conservative, given the tough comps. The firm is of the view that the management's strategy centers on scaling original content to create a competitive moat, although most investors have not bought into the idea.\n\n###  Google: Bullish On Short-term Fundamentals\n\nCanaccord is bullish on **Alphabet Inc** (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL)'s short-term fundamentals, banking on mobile and YouTube. The firm views the fact that the company does not issue guidance, unlike other FANG stocks, as favorable. While highlighting gross margin degradation as a major concern, the firm said website growth can compensate.\n\n### Others In the Internet Space\n\n  * **GrubHub Inc** (NYSE: GRUB): The stock is seen screening well on profitability, with 2017 estimates viewed as conservative.\n  * **Pandora Media Inc** (NYSE: P): Positive impressions revealed by recent products but short-term ad business is a concern; potential upside to subscriber conversion to Pandora Premium next year seen to compensate.\n  * **Wayfair Inc** (NYSE: W): Mid-quarter metrics point to modest upside to fourth-quarter guidance; breaking international vs. domestic profitability a key positive.\n  * **Zillow Group, Inc.**(NASDAQ: ZG): Valuation and stock-based compensation headwinds; a conservative 2017 guidance could elicit stock reaction; potential for the new self-serve ad buying platform to contribute to pricing upside in the Q2 and Q3 not discounted.\n\n\n\n### Ratings And Price Targets\n\n  * Alphabet's Google: Buy, with $925 price target.\n  * Amazon: Buy, with $875 price target.\n  * Facebook: Buy, with $150 price target.\n  * GrubHub: Buy, with $48 price target.\n  * Pandora: Buy, with $18 price target.\n  * Wayfair: Buy, with $45 price target.\n  * Zillow Group: Buy, with $42 price target."
 'There are 1.3 billion reasons why Detroit\'s automakers and Silicon Valley\'s hottest startups can\'t compete with Elon Musk\'s **Tesla Motors Inc** (NASDAQ: TSLA).\n\nAccording to a Bloomberg Technology report,, Tesla has amassed 1.3 billion miles of data from its cars equipped with self-driving technologies -- not only in its home base of sunny California but across diverse road and weather conditions across the planet.\n\nHowever, it should be noted that the 1.3 billion figure may be a bit deceptive, as it includes miles driven when the autopilot feature is not engaged. Nevertheless, it the feature operates in "shadow mode" and sensors are active in tracking the real-world data.\n\nWall Street analysts, including Trip Chowdhry of Global Equities Research, have been active in highlighting Tesla\'s massive advantage of its automaker peers.\n\nMusk tweeted in October that the total number of cumulative "Autopilot-on" miles stood at 222 million -- still an impressive feature, which is no match for **General Motors Company** (NYSE: GM) and even **Alphabet Inc** (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL)\'s Google unit to compete with. In fact, Karl Brauer, the executive publisher for Kelley Blue Book told Bloomberg that most automakers and technology companies don\'t want to disclose how far they are in the autonomous vehicle race. Naturally, Musk is the lone exception, as he is "always out there claiming how far ahead of everyone else he is."\n\n"There\'s no question that Tesla has an advantage," Nindhi Kalra, a senior information scientist at the Rand Corporation told Bloomberg. "They can learn from a wider range of experiences and at a much faster rate than a company that is testing with trained drivers and employees behind the wheel."'
 'Seasoned traders know rumors are a major part of the Wall Street world. Rumors can be both frustrating and profitable to traders who time them right because the rumors don\'t actually need to turn out to be true to influence share prices.\n\nHere\'s a look at seven of the biggest rumors of 2016 and how they were resolved.\n\n### Top 7 Rumors Of 2016\n\n### 1\\. Icahn And Ackman\n\n**The Rumor:** Carl Icahn may sell his **Herbalife Ltd.**(NYSE: HFL) shares to Herbalife short-seller Bill Ackman.\n\n**The Outcome:** False.\n\nBack in August, Ackman told CNBC that Jefferies Group had approached him about buying a portion of Icahn\'s large stake in Herbalife. In reality, Icahn actually increased his Herbalife stake by 2.3 million shares.\n\n### 2\\. Disney And Twitter, Round 1\n\n**The Rumor:** **Walt Disney Co** (NYSE: DIS) is buying **Twitter Inc** (NYSE: TWTR), round one.\n\n**The Outcome:** False.\n\nIn September, Bloomberg reported that Disney was working with a financial advisor to evaluate a Twitter buyout. Twitter\'s stock jumped on the news, but no such deal ever took place.\n\n### 3\\. Disney and Twitter, Round 2\n\n**The Rumor:** Wald Disney is buying Twitter, round two.\n\n**The Outcome:** Still False.\n\nRoughly a month after the first rumor, another Betaville alert suggested that Twitter and Disney were "thrashing out a deal." Twitter\'s stock again spiked on the rumor, which again failed to result in a deal.\n\n### 4\\. Comcast And Level 3\n\n**The Rumor:** **Comcast Corporation** (NASDAQ: CMCSA) is buying **Level 3 Communications, Inc.** (NYSE: LVLT).\n\n**The Outcome:** False.\n\nBack in July, Benzinga Pro reported that Level 3 was reviewing strategic alternatives for its business, including an outright sale of the company. An industry source speculated that Comcast could be the best suitor for Level 3, but **Centurylink Inc** (NYSE: CTL) stepped in with a roughly $24 billion bid for Level 3 instead.\n\n### 5\\. Puma\'s Secondary Offering\n\n**The Rumor:** **Puma Biotechnology Inc** (NYSE: PUMA) might pull its secondary offering due to lack of investor demand.\n\n**The Outcome:** False.\n\nIn October, a rumor circulated that Puma might not generate enough market demand to go through with its secondary offering in the $40-$42 range. Puma ultimately went through with the offering at $40 and was able to find enough buyers to reach its $150 million goal.\n\n### 6\\. Relypsa As A Buyout\n\n**The Rumor: Relypsa Inc** (previously traded (NASDAQ: RLYP)) is a buyout target.\n\n**The Outcome:** True.\n\nRumors swirled early in 2016 that Relypsa would be acquired after the biotech company hired an advisory firm. The rumors proved true when Relypsa announced a $1.53 billion buyout by Switzerland\'s Galencia Group in July.\n\n### 7\\. Alphabet And Box\n\n**The Rumor: Alphabet Inc** (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) will buy **Box Inc** (NYSE: BOX).\n\n**The Outcome:** False.\n\nWhen Alphabet announced a partnership with Box back in September, some traders speculated that the table could be set for a Box buyout. So far, no such deal has materialized.\n\nStanford\'s standout running back Christian McCaffrey has announced he will forego the 9-3 team\'s bowl game in order to prepare for the 2017 NFL draft.\n\nWhile McCaffrey initially indicated that he was preparing for the team\'s upcoming appearance in the Sun Bowl, he quickly shifted his plans after announcing on Twitter that he would not be playing in his team\'s match up versus North Carolina.\n\n"Very tough decision, but I have decided not to play in the Sun Bowl so I can begin my draft prep immediately," McCaffrey wrote on **Twitter Inc**(NYSE: TWTR).\n\nAnalysts have speculated that McCaffrey\'s decision is setting the stage for other players to follow suit in the future, setting a trend for NFL-ready players to avoid meaningless bowl games and prevent potential injury.\n\n"I think that this is going to start happening a lot," said Ryen Russillo of ESPN. "When you look at the way college athletics have been talked about the last few years there is almost outrage as to how unfair this system is," he added.\n\nMcCaffrey\'s decision to leave Stanford early lists him among some notable individuals who chose to leave the prestigious university early to start their careers.\n\nTiger Woods left Stanford after just one year, quickly announcing his coming out party to the world. However, Woods indicated in 2016 that his one regret in his life was that he left college early for the pros.\n\nTennis bad boy John McEnroe also left Stanford early to begin his legendary career on the court.\n\nStanford has no shortage of tech pioneers who left school early to start their multi-billion dollar startups, including Snapchat\'s Evan Spiegal and **Alphabet Inc**(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL)\'s co-founder Sergey Brin.\n\nNo matter what people say about McCaffrey\'s controversial decision, one can\'t deny he among good company.\n\n_Image Credit: By Bobak Ha\'Eri - Own work, CC BY 3.0,Wikimedia Commons_ Jonathan Golub of RBC Capital Markets was a guest on CNBC\'s "Squawk Box" segment on Monday to talk about the hot topic of the week -- Dow 20k.\n\n### Dow Versus S&P; Index\n\nGolub started off by stating that the Dow Jones is a superior index to gauge the overall market, even though the index has just a handful of stocks as opposed to the 500 in the S&P; index.\n\nGolub noted that the Dow has a "huge weight" in financial and industrial stocks and doesn\'t own underperforming tech stocks such as **Alphabet Inc** (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) and **Facebook Inc** (NASDAQ: FB)."Normally 30 stocks is a silly index, but right now it\'s probably a better gauge of the sentiment of the market," he said.\n\n### Plow Through 20,000\n\nGolub believes the Dow index will continue surging through 2017 and it doesn\'t really matter if the index hits 20,000 this year or early next year.\n\nHe cited the prospect of higher interest rates coupled with improved business and consumer sentiments for the continued surge in the stock market. In addition, the stronger U.S. dollar will continue to attract international investors who will now be buying American stocks.\n\nIn terms of higher interest rates, Golub suggested it is "not the devil" many believe it to be. Specifically, higher interest rates could act as a "bailout" for many Americans who couldn\'t afford to retire because they couldn\'t receive a proper income on their money but are now "seeing a much better situation."\n\nDespite **Alphabet Inc** (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) benefiting from several secular tailwinds and management actively buying back shares, Aegis Capital\'s Victor Anthony believes investor sentiment has been low on the stock during 2016 due to tough revenue comps and expectations of margin pressure at the core Google segment.\n\nAnthony initiated coverage of the company with a Buy rating and price target of $980.\n\n### Working Through Concerns\n\nThe analyst also pointed out that in recent time, "the Trump impact" and FX have also been causes of concern for investors.\n\nHowever, Anthony believes the stock should work through these concerns "due to growth opportunities in Search as a result of new and enhanced ad formats and AI, continued strength at YouTube, and growth of enterprise cloud computing."\n\nThe combination of these factors is also expected to offset the tough comps and margin pressures from increasing traffic acquisition costs, growth investments and hardware sales, while the FX and Trump impact are non-fundamental issues.\n\n### Growth Drivers\n\n"To the contrary, we see faster EPS accretion from a lower corporate tax rate, and higher share repurchases, if the 60 percent of Alphabet\'s cash domiciled oversees was repatriated and used to aggressively repurchase shares," the analyst mentioned.\n\nIn addition, Anthony noted that mobile search remained a significant driver of search growth, with newer ad formats, along with device bidding, expected to increase advertiser ROI and drive increased ad spend on Google.\n\nMoreover, YouTube has been a meaningful driver of revenue growth for Alphabet over the past two years, and with the ongoing secular shift of video to online, the analyst expects YouTube to continue to grow at a rapid pace.\n\n###  Top Upgrades\n\n  * Atlantic Equities upgraded **Morgan Stanley** (NYSE: MS) from Underweight to Neutral.

 '**Snap Inc.** , formerly known as Snapchat, confidentially filed for an  IPO ahead of the presidential elections, valuing the company at roughly $25 billion. Now that the news has broken, here\'s a look at the company, its products and what has transpired since the reports of the IPO filing.\n\n### Making A Social Media Splash\n\nThe five-year-old startup conceived by three Stanford graduates has made a name for itself among social media firms. So much so that **Facebook Inc** (NASDAQ: FB)\'s Instagram has aped its  Stories and has even found  success  with it. Data from Statista show Snapchat had 150 million daily active users in June 2016, up from 110 million global DAU in December 2015 -- a 36 percent growth in six months.\n\n### Backed By Prestigious Investors\n\nSnap Inc.\'s appeal has lured many high-profile investors, including **Alphabet Inc** (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL)\'s Google, **Alibaba Group Holding Ltd** (NYSE: BABA) and **Yahoo! Inc.**(NASDAQ: YHOO). CapitalG, one of the two venture capital arms of Google, has listed  Snap Inc.  as one of its portfolio companies.\n\nReports suggest that the IPO could come as early as March 2017 and at a valuation of $20 billion to $25 billion, over six times the bid value Facebook had for the company back in 2013.\n\n### What Snapchat Does\n\nThe company is a mobile messaging and multimedia sharing app, which was initially used to share impermanent images via private message "snaps" that can be viewed for a user-specified length of time before disappearing. Now, video has become an important feature of Snapchat. Multimedia messages, known as snaps, consisting of a photo or a short video, edited with text, filers, stickers and other overlays, are shared as a semi-public story or sent privately.\n\n### Hardware Foray\n\nIn September, the company said it had developed a new type of camera called Spectacles, marking a foray into hardware business. Spectacles are sunglasses with an integrated inbuilt wireless video camera, which can be connected directly to Snapchat through Bluetooth or Wi-Fi to transfer Memories directly into the app. \n\n### Name Change\n\nAhead of the announcement concerning the launch of its Spectacles, the company announced a name change to the current Snap Inc. from Snapchat, with the change intended to accommodate additional products such as Spectacles. Another reasoning given was that a Snap Inc. search could throw up financial data et al, which are of interest to Wall Street. Furthermore, users seeking information on specific products can access relevant information with ease and convenience without having to go through the irrelevant financial information. \n\n### Chinese R&D; Office\n\nMeanwhile, the company announced the opening of a technology office in the southern city of Shenzhen, China, for research & development on Sunglasses. Spectacles are already being assembled in China.\n\n### Flite Buy?\n\nA  report by Recode contributor Kurt Wagner  suggested that Snap has bought ad tech company Flite. In October, Snap unveiled its ads API, allowing third parties sell Snapchat\'s ad inventory using automated bidding algorithm in a bid to increase its ad inventories. \n\nJefferies is positive on an announcement from **Honda Motor Co Ltd (ADR)**(NYSE: HMC) that it has entered into formal discussions with **Alphabet Inc** (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL)\'s Waymo over integration of its self-driving technology with Honda vehicles.\n\n### Way More Progress With Waymo\n\nThe news comes just a week after Alphabet announced it is spinning out its self-driving car project into a new company called Waymo. Alphabet is investing heavily in self driving technology and has logged over 2 million driverless pre-mapped miles (and another billion in simulation) since testing began back in 2009.\n\nThe potential deal could allow Waymo to deploy its self-driving sensors and software in Honda vehicles.\n\n"The news supports our expectation that Waymo will be focused on technology with the potential to license to vehicle manufacturers rather than making the cars themselves," analyst Brian Fitzgerald wrote in a note.\n\n### The Technology\n\nCurrently, the analyst said he is mostly at Level 2 (according to NHTSA automation levels), which is essentially partial automation or "hands off" rather than full conditional automation or "eyes off." He believes no company has full autonomous vehicles in production.\n\n"While we are encouraged by the advancements Google is making, right now we do not have self-driving vehicle efforts modeled in our long term numbers," Fitzgerald continued.\n\nThe analyst seeks parallel development of both connected and autonomous vehicles. As of now, connected vehicle technology currently lags autonomous vehicle technology, but both can develop in tandem along with proper infrastructure support.\n\nMeanwhile, Research and Markets forecasts the global autonomous vehicle development platform market to grow at a CAGR of 105.56 percent during the period 2017-2021 on improved smartphone ecosystem.\n\n### Analyst\'s Bottom Line\n\nFitzgerald has a Buy rating on Alphabet shares, with a price target of $1,000.\n\n**NVIDIA Corporation** (NASDAQ: NVDA) was one of the hottest tech companies trading this year. One of the investors who got in early was Cody Willard.\n\nWillard, a former hedge fund manager and the publisher of the blog "Trading With Cody," was on Tuesday\'s episode of Benzinga\'s PreMarket Prep where he discussed his history trading tech stocks, including his most recent position with Nvidia.\n\n### A History Of Hits\n\nWillard\'s track record trading in the tech sector is prolific and impressive. "My biggest positions are **Apple Inc.** (NASDAQ: AAPL), which I\'ve owned since march 2003 with $1 cost basis on my first shares. I\'ve owned **Alphabet Inc** (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) since the day it went public with about a $45 cost basis. NVDA is my biggest home run this year."\n\nHowever, he did want to stress that not all of his picks were as successful, pointing specifically to **Fitbit Inc** (NYSE: FIT)\'s 2016 dip.\n\n### Picking Winners\n\nWillard bought in on Nvidia late in 2015 when the stock was still below $30. He said the reason Nvidia stood out was based on the company\'s market position relative to where the technology industry is currently headed. "I think A.I. and self-driving cars and so much of the stuff that Nvidia positioned itself for, in the next five years will probably be where the next big hit lands."\n\nGenerally, Willard said he looks for technology companies that are in a position not only to disrupt the industry, but to revolutionize the world. "If any company can find a way to become the de facto standard in that industry, that company will be worth tens of billions of dollars."\n\n### The Next Nvidia\n\nWhile he was on the show, Willard shared his thoughts on what technology could end up generating the next market mover. He mentioned cloud computing and application development, but singled out RFID technology and its possible application in **Amazon.com, Inc.** (NASDAQ: AMZN) proposed automated checkout grocery stores.\n\nListen to the full explanation from in the clip below.\n\n_PreMarket Prep is a daily morning show about short term trading ideas and technical setups.

 "**Facebook Inc** (NASDAQ: FB) was a social media startup that many believed didn't' have a chance of dethroning the leader at the time, Myspace.\n\nNeedless to say, the social media platform has come a long way over the past 10 years when it boasted a mere 12 million total active users.\n\nHere is a look back at some fun facts about what Facebook looked like 10 years ago when the News Feed was a new feature and the platform consisted of merely a collection of disconnected profiles.\n\nHere is a screen shot of what Mark Zuckerberg's profile looked like in 2006. All of the screen shots were compiled by Business Insider.\n\nHere is what the wildly unpopular News Feed looked like after it was introduced in September, 2006.\n\nFacebook also released at the same its Mini-Feed feature, which also received a poor reception from Facebook's community of users.\n\nHere are some other notable developments that occurred in 2006:\n\n  * April 1: Facebook launches Facebook for Mobile for the first time.\n  * May 1: Users can now add work networks.\n  * August 1: Facebook introduces for the very first time its version of the Facebook API.\n  * September 26: For the first time ever, anyone over the age of 13 with a valid e-mail account can now join the network.\n  * Unknown Dates: **Yahoo! Inc.** (NASDAQ: YHOO) and Google (now trading **Alphabet Inc** (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL)) expressed interest in acquiring Facebook for around $2 billion.\n\nThe year 2016 has been kind to the markets despite much economic turbulence experienced globally during the year. The domestic economic growth came in at an anemic 0.8 percent in the first quarter, casting doubts on the sustainability of the economic recovery in the works. \n\nIn the meantime, the Chinese economy was also stuttering. Additionally, there was considerable uncertainty surrounding the U.S. presidential elections, while the Brexit referendum vote triggered concerns about the economic ramification of the decision.\n\n### Resilient Markets\n\nThe markets showed resilience in standing up to these challenges and emerging with flying colors. The **S &P; 500 ** has been up 10.82 percent in the year-to-date period, while the **Dow Jones Industrial Average 2 Minute** and the **NASDAQ Composite** are 14.4 percent and 9.3 percent higher, respectively, during the same period. The Dow stands in the threshold of breaking above the psychological barrier of 20,000 for the first time ever, even as the other gauges are trading just off their highs.\n\n### FANG Rally Loses Steam In 2016\n\nThe FANG stocks that were responsible for much of the markets' advances in 2015, given their heavy weightings in the major indexes, appear on track to close in the green for the year, although the gains have been much more moderate.\n\n**Facebook Inc** (NASDAQ: FB), **Amazon.com, Inc.**(NASDAQ: AMZN), **Netflix, Inc.** (NASDAQ: NFLX) and Google's parent ** Alphabet Inc ** (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) have gained 13.7 percent, 14 percent, 10.6 percent and 4.4 percent, respectively. In comparison, Netflix had run up 134 percent in 2015.\n\n### Old Economy Stocks Outperform\n\nAmong the S&P; sectors,  old economy sectors  such as energy, financials, material and industrials fared well this year. Healthcare is the only major sector in the red currently. \n\n### Top S&P; 500 Stocks\n\nHere is the list of the top 6 S&P; 500 stocks of the year 2016:\n\n**1\\. NVIDIA Corporation**(NASDAQ: NVDA): (+221 percent year-to-date).\n\nAfter moving roughly sideways until May,  Nvidia  began a steady climb that is continuing through the end of the year. The company is the unparalleled leader in the graphics chip market. The company has consistently delivered forecast-beating results.\n\nIn a note released earlier this month, Loop Capital said the company's gaming business would benefit from the continued rise of eSports, traditional gamers, artificial reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR). For context, the gaming market accounted for 62 percent of NVIDIA's third-quarter revenues.\n\nAnother key growth driver for NVIDIA is likely to come from autonomous car market, especially from **Tesla Motors Inc**(NASDAQ: TSLA). Nvidia already supplies Tegra processors for infotainment for the automobile market and provides an end-to-end AI computing platform for autonomous driving.\n\n**2\\. ONEOK, Inc.** (NYSE: OKE): (+137.4 percent in the year-to-date period).\n\nAfter a lukewarm start to the year, ONEOK stock saw a steady rise till June. Moving roughly sideways once again, the stock has jumped in to partake in the Trump rally. This natural gas utility company has been riding on the rebound in commodity prices this year. ONEOK is the general partner of master limited partnership **Oneok Partners LP** (NYSE: OKS).\n\n**3\\. Freeport-McMoRan Inc** (NYSE: FCX): (+107.5 percent in the year-to-date period).\n\nFreeport-McMoRan, which sunk close to an all-time low in January this year, has staged a nice recovery since then. The copper miner's fortunes turned around as the commodity story improved and the company exercised financial discipline in extricating itself from the rot. \n\n**4\\. Computer Sciences Corporation**(NYSE: CSC): (+86.8 percent in the year-to-date period).\n\nThis technology services company had a so-so year until May. After a steep ascent, the stock was locked in another consolidation phase until October and has seen another leg up since. This company consistently beats Street earnings expectations and has gone through some transformation this year. \n\nIn late 2015, the company spun off its U.S. government business into a separate publicly traded company **CSRA Inc**(NYSE: CSRA). The company also announced plans to merge itself with **Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co**(NYSE: HPE) Enterprise Services segment, with the merger expected to be completed by the end of March 2017.\n\n**5\\. Newmont Mining Corp**(NYSE: NEM): (+75.4 percent in the year-to-date period).\n\nThis gold miner has run up along with the rise in gold prices. Gold futures have been up 6.6 percent for the year, with its safe haven status offering it support in the first half of the year when risk aversion ran amok. However, with the dollar strength in the wake of expectations of a  Fed hike, which materialized in December this year, gold has come off the boil. Nevertheless, this stock has clocked in a remarkable return.\n\n**6\\. Applied Materials, Inc.**(NASDAQ: AMAT): (+74.5 percent in the year-to-date period).\n\nThis chip equipment maker has seen a steady climb since February this year.\n\nApart from these S&P; 500 companies, strong gains were recorded by companies such as **Sprint Corp** (NYSE: S), which clocked gains of 136 percent in the year-to-date period. Thus, as the year 2016 hits the homestretch, investors can look back at the year with a smile in their face, as the decent gains of the year set the cash registers ringing."
 '**Apple Inc.** (NASDAQ: AAPL)\'s iPhone, which was introduced on June 29, 2007, has been a runaway hit for the Cupertino, California-based company. In  fiscal year 2016, the company derived roughly 63.4 percent or $136.70 billion of its total revenues from the iPhone.\n\nWork on the iConic phone began well ahead of its launch, with the development said to have begun in 2004. There is a story doing the rounds that the iPhone was conceptualized when late Steve Jobs wanted a device that would allow him to read e-mail in the bathroom. The development was kept under wraps despite the company working with partners like Cingular, which is now part of **AT &T; Inc. ** (NYSE: T), **Yahoo! Inc.** (NASDAQ: YHOO) and **Alphabet Inc** (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL)\'s Google. The project to develop the iPhone was known as Project Purple back then.\n\n### The iTeam\n\nBenzinga looked at some of the engineers involved in the original iPhone development team and where they are currently positioned.\n\n* **Scott Forstall** , who served as senior vice president of iOS Software at Apple from 2007 until October 2012, was vested with the responsibility of software development for the iPhone and the iPad.\n\nIn a  testimony, Forstall said he was vested with the responsibility of hiring people from inside the company project, giving them little details, given the secrecy shrouding the project.\n\nAfter his unceremonious exit from Apple in 2012, seen as a result of his abrasive personality, he kept a low profile until April 2015, when he revealed via a tweet that was a co-producer of the Broadway version of musical "Fun Home." Forstall is reportedly advising  Snapchat  currently.\n\n**\n* Sir Jonathan Paul Jony Ive** is the face behind the design of many Apple products, including MacBook Pro, iMac, MacBook Air, Mac mini, iPod, iPod Touch, iPad, iPad Mini, Apple Watch, iOS and iPhone. He currently serves as the chief design officer of Apple, overseeing its Industrial Design Group and providing leadership and direction for Human Interface software teams across the company.\n\n* **Greg Christie,** who is credited a being one of the inventors of Apple\'s slide to unlock system on the iPhone, left Apple in 2014, seen as a result of differences over design decisions with Ive. He was supposedly drafted into the iPhone team by Forstall in 2004, with the vague hint that the device he would be working on would be a phone with an integrated music player, operated by touch screen.\n* **Phil Schiller** , Apple\'s senior VP of worldwide marketing, had also been involved in the project right from inception. He continues to head marketing at Apple.\n* **Andy Grignon** was a senior manager on the iPhone and took care of the radio software workings. He later joined Palm to co-invent webOS and oversaw the release of 13 versions of webOS. He co-founded a new start-up called Quake Labs, which allows users to create rich media projects on their mobile devices and PCs.\n* **Jeremy Wyld** , who was also part of the original iPhone team, was responsible for founding Quake Labs along with Grignon.\nJames Cakmak is an equity analyst with Monness, Crespi, Hardt & Co. and was a guest on CNBC on Tuesday to discuss which technology stocks will be a winner in 2017.\n\n### Twitter\n\nCakmak said that he wants to be positive on **Twitter Inc** (NYSE: TWTR), but it is becoming more difficult to defend the company. He added that confidence among marketers who chose to promote their products online is "eroding," which merely adds to the company\'s woes.\n\nBefore Cakmak can become positive on Twitter, the platform\'s user growth needs to return.\n\n### Alphabet, Amazon\n\nCakmak was then asked if he is surprised that the market hasn\'t been as friendly to **Alphabet Inc** (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) and **Amazon.com, Inc.** (NASDAQ: AMZN), as they have been to the broader market.\n\nThe analyst answered that this reaction was surprising for Alphabet, but not for Amazon. \n\nCakmak continued that Alphabet is not only valued attractively but is "finally starting to hid their stride" in terms of mobile, machine learning, voice-based search and other new growth initiatives.\n\nMoving on to Amazon, the analyst suggested there is a disconnect between buy-side expectations and reality. Cakmak believes Amazon\'s lofty AWS segment could soon see pricing pressure which could impact the company\'s margin profile in the coming year.\n\n### Snap IPO\n\nFinally, Cakmak was asked if Snap\'s highly-anticipated IPO will result in investors selling other technology stocks to free up capital to buy shares of the newly issued social media company.\n\nThe analyst believes this may be the case, as Snap is poised to see outsized gains above the Street\'s already lofty expectations. \n\nHigh-flier **NVIDIA Corporation** (NASDAQ: NVDA) may see its gravity defying upward momentum stall soon. It is one of the  biggest gainers  among the S&P 500 stocks in 2016, riding on the surging demand for graphics chips.\n\n###  High-Flier Faces Risk Of Retreat\n\nCitron Research said in a  tweet  that NVIDIA may be heading back to $90 in 2017, as the market is currently disregarding headwinds. After over a 255 percent gain in 2016, the stock closed Tuesday\'s session at $117.32. The target Citron is having for 2017 suggests a downside of about 23 percent from current levels.\n\nThis is in contrast to views of some  Wall Street analysts, who see the rally continuing into 2017.\n\n###  6 Risks\n\nCitron listed six risks the markets are currently discounting and that could have a bearing on the company\'s stock heading into 2017:\n\n    1. NVIDIA\'s growth has come mainly from gaming and at the expense of **Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.**(NASDAQ: AMD). The company hasn\'t managed to grow its new total addressable markets.\n    2. Citron sees competitive threat from **Intel Corporation** (NASDAQ: INTC), AMD and **Xilinx, Inc.** (NASDAQ: XLNX) in the data center market (from Intel\'s Xeon, AMD\'s Radeon Pro etc.). Additionally, the firm believes AMD\'s new GPUs for desktop and server is due in the first quarter and second quarter of 2017, respectively.\n    3. The embedded intellectual property that just NVIDIA\'s premium valuation may not be the prerogative of the company alone, as Intel has access to this IP from a licensing deal with NVIDIA that ends this year.\n    4. Citron believes Intel licensing revenue attrition will have a significant effect on NVIDIA\'s 2017 EBITDA.\n    5. Citron also sees competition from custom silicon and GPU workarounds from existing customers such as **Alphabet Inc** (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) Google\'s TPU and **Apple Inc.** (NASDAQ: AAPL).\n    6. The firm sees significant pressure for NVIDIA\'s gross margins, as Intel enters the fray in mid-2017. As opposed to Intel, which is vertically integrated, NVIDIA is a fabless producer, with **Taiwan Semiconductor Mfg. Co. Ltd. (ADR)** (NYSE: TSM) making all of its GPUs. Intel can charge 37 percent less for its chips and still generate 80 percent gross margins.\n\n\n\nAt the time of writing, NVIDIA was slipping 3.64 percent to $113.05.'
 'If the past decade of news stories and fraud alerts haven\'t put you on your guard for scams, 2017 should be the year to make sure you are protected against these schemes. This is especially true as scammers are deploying newer and more sophisticated tactics to relieve you of your savings, your identity and more.\n\nFraud statistics are difficult to track, particularly because no one likes admitting they have been had. However, the elderly are a common target of scammers for a variety of reasons. The FBI\'s Scams and Safety web page points out that seniors generally have more savings than younger targets and are less likely to report fraud due to limited information on where to report it to.\n\nThis graphic from the Financial Services Roundtable illustrates the common elements of fraud against the elderly.\n\n### 2016 Scams\n\nYour greatest asset to avoid becoming a victim of fraud is to be informed of the tactics and psychology behind these scams.\n\nThe Better Business Bureau recently released it statistics on the top ten most common scams perpetrated and reported in 2016. You can see their list below.\n\nWhile the BBB did report a sharp decrease in the number of reports following a raid on an IRS scam ring in Mumbai, India, top fraudulence was still primarily perpetrated by people impersonating government officials and demanding money. Gaining ground are similar scam strategies wherein fraudsters promise huge rewards or threaten victims financially unless they receive payment.\n\n### 2 Things To Be Aware Of\n\n    1. **Urgency:** The urgency and gravity of these money demands are what make them successful. The scammers will throw a lot of information at the victim very quickly and will even scream at them, all to keep the victim off-balance, scared and eager to do whatever it takes to satisfy the scammer\'s demands.\n    2. **Familiarity:** The person demanding payment may have some information about you or a family member that they will use to convince you their demands are legitimate.\n\n\n\nYour main weapon against these demands is to remain calm and to withhold any information the scammer could use to draw you in further. If you are unsure of whether a call is truly from the IRS or a debt collection agency, ask for contact information and tell them you will contact them after consulting with someone you trust.\n\nA good rule of thumb is that if they refuse and continue to demand money, they are just trying to score quick money off you. These scams usually rely on frequency, and if they can\'t get money from you right now, they will move on to another person.\n\n### Online Scams And Identity Theft\n\nWhile online shopping and email scams seeking to acquire credit card or personal information from you (phishing) are lower on the BBB\'s list, the incidence of these may be under reported because the crime may go unnoticed.\n\nThe New York Times reported on the recent tactic used by hackers to gain access to the Democratic National Committee\'s email. The hackers sent emails that looked like they were from a trusted source, **Alphabet Inc** (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL), with a link to what appeared to be a login page for the gmail service. However, the page was a fake. Without knowing it, victims supplied their account name and password to the scammers, giving them access to all the information therein.\n\nAgain, the methods of these types of scams vary, but the aim is consistent: to gain access to your personal or financial information.\n\nTo avoid becoming a victim of online fraud, you should employ every precaution against opening suspicious messages from unfamiliar email accounts and thoroughly verify online companies and web addresses. You can do this by researching companies and scam tactics online or at the BBB\'s website, inspecting whether a website\'s address matches the site\'s name, and remaining aware of any hints in the messages that it might be fake like poor grammar or typos.\n\n### Staying Vigilant\n\nScams of all stripes are becoming more frequent, elaborate and tenacious as time goes on. Even as you and watchdog groups find new ways to prevent fraud and protect consumers, scammers will continue to seek ways to profit off your fear, uncertainty, or ambition.\n\nIf you feel like you or a loved one have been the victim of a scam, or if you feel like your finances and personal information are at risk, contact the Better Business Bureau and talk to your financial planner about specific measures you can take to protect both your money and yourself.\n\nTech giants **Facebook Inc** (NASDAQ: FB), **Amazon.com, Inc.** (NASDAQ: AMZN), **Netflix, Inc.**(NASDAQ: NFLX) and **Alphabet Inc** (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL), collectively known as "FANG," have been four of the top-performing stocks in the market in recent years. In fact, from 2013 to 2016, all of the FANG stocks more than doubled in price, led by Netflix\'s incredible +770 percent surge.\n\nJust last year, Amazon and Netflix were the top two stocks in the entire S&P 500.\n\n### FANG\'s 2016\n\nWhile 2016 hasn\'t been quite as impressive of a year for the FANG group as recent years have been, all four stocks continued their slow march higher this year. Amazon and Netflix got off to a very bumpy start to the year, both falling more than 25 percent in the opening weeks of 2016. However, all four stocks are now poised to finish the year with modest gains.\n\nAmazon is the leader of the FANG group for 2016. The e-commerce juggernaut delivered another year of impressive growth and a 12.8 percent market gain.\n\nFacebook was not far behind, up 11.3 percent in 2016.\n\nNetflix was down on the year as recently as the fourth quarter before mounting a year-end comeback and pushing to +8.9 percent in 2016.\n\nGoogle was the lone market laggard among the FANG stocks. The stock managed just a 2.8 percent gain compared to a +8.9 percent year for the **SPDR S &P 500 ETF Trust** (NYSE: SPY).\n\nSkynet, the fictional artificial intelligence system popularized in the Terminatorfranchise, is what comes to many people\'s minds once they learn that **Samsung** \'s robotic vacuum can be controlled by **Amazon.com, Inc.** (NASDAQ: AMZN)\'s artificial intelligence assistant Echo.\n\n### Inter-Machine Communication\n\nSamsung\'s Powerbot VR7000 is equipped with "several intelligent features that power the unit\'s automated performance." The vacuum is equipped with maps and sensors and can learn to navigate the contours of a room and avoid obstacles and small items.\n\nThe coolest (or most alarming) feature is that the robot is compatible with Amazon Echo using voice commands.\n\nNaturally, no one is saying that the millions of Amazon Echo devices will collaborate with a high-tech vacuum machine to make the artificial intelligence Skynet self aware and initiate a global nuclear war.\n\n### The \'Big Red Button\': Interruptibility\n\nIn the unlikely event that this does become a reality, humans can breathe a sigh of relief, knowing that **Alphabet Inc** (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) is developing a "big red button", once pressed, will automatically "pull the plug" on all of its self-learning machines.\n\n"Safe interruptibility can be useful to take control of a robot that is misbehaving and may lead to irreversible consequences, or to take it out of a delicate situation, or even to temporarily use it to achieve a task it did not learn to perform or would not normally receive rewards for this," Google\'s research lab said in its decision to include the kill switch.\n\nSamsung will showcase its new vacuum at the 2017 CES event, which runs from January 5 through January 8.']
