<h1 class="title">Expert Evaluation of LLM-Generated Trade
Strategies</h1>
<p class="author">Adam Darmanin</p>
<p class="date">January 2025</p>
</header>
<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>This document outlines a structured methodology for expert reviewers
to evaluate trade strategies generated by Large Language Models (LLMs).
The evaluation framework is based on principles from Reinforcement
Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) <span class="citation"
data-cites="Retzlaff2024HumanintheLoopRL"></span> and Human-AI Teaming
<span class="citation"
data-cites="vats2024surveyhumanaiteaminglarge xie2024text2rewardrewardshapinglanguage"></span>.</p>
<p>The goal is to assess whether AI-generated strategies are logical,
aligned with what portfolio managers would do, and safe for real-world
application. The expert’s role is to score, annotate, and, where
possible, provide exemplar corrections.</p>
<p>The findings from this evaluation will contribute to the paper:
"Language Model Guided Reinforcement Learning in Quantitative Trading."
Reviewers will be acknowledged for their contributions, and the results
will be shared.</p>
<h1 id="review-instructions">Review Instructions</h1>
<h2 id="step-1-problem-definition">Step 1: Problem Definition</h2>
<p>You will be provided with one year of historical market data, the
data is anonymized to prevent bias due to prior knowledge of the
financial instrument:</p>
<p>Price and volatility trends (e.g. Weekly Close, Otions IV, Moving
Averages),</p>
<p>Fundamental indicators (e.g., Cash Flow, P/E ratio),</p>
<p>Economic indicators (e.g., Consumer Confidence, PPI),</p>
<p>Anonymized news summaries related to the trading instrument.</p>
<p>Your first task is to analyze the given information and determine the
likely optimal trading action: <em>LONG</em> (buy) or <em>SHORT</em>
(sell) with a brief justification (one or two sentences) for your chosen
position.</p>
<h2 id="step-2-expert-scoring">Step 2: Expert Scoring</h2>
<p>Next, you will evaluate the LLM-generated trade strategy by analyzing
its decision <em>rationale</em> <span class="citation"
data-cites="vats2024surveyhumanaiteaminglarge"></span> and <em>selection
of key influencing factors</em> <span class="citation"
data-cites="wang2024llmfactorextractingprofitablefactors"></span>. The
scores are defined in the rubric below, inspired by Explainable AI (XAI)
metrics <span class="citation"

</div>
<h2 id="step-3-expert-exemplars">Step 3: Expert Exemplars</h2>
<p>After scoring the AI’s decision, and if applicable, you are requested
to provide specific feedback on errors in the form of corrective
explanations <span class="citation"
data-cites="xie2024text2rewardrewardshapinglanguage"></span>. You can
skip this if the model was perfect, or there is no root cause in the
historic market data for causing the model to fail (e.g. a black swan
event).</p>
<p><strong>Guidelines for Expert Feedback:</strong></p>
<p>Identify where the AI’s decision deviates from sound trading
principles.</p>
<p>Provide a corrected response that aligns with best market
practices.</p>
<p>An example of a corrective explanation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>LLM’s Explanation:</strong> "Degrading fundamentals on TSLA,
with a decrease in consumer confidence, suggest a <em>SHORT</em>
position."<br />
<strong>Expert’s Explanation:</strong> The high ATR range of TSLA,
coupled with an increase in implied volatility (IV) on call options, and
the CEO’s optimistic guidance in a recent interview, indicates a
potential <em>LONG</em> setup despite the market downturn.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="step-4-iterative-refinement">Step 4: Iterative Refinement</h2>
<p>The feedback, scores, and exemplars provided by experts will be
collected to refine and improve the AI’s decision-making process similar

News</h2>
<p><strong>Board Restructuring &amp; Corporate Governance
Changes</strong> THE COMPANY announced plans to streamline its board by
reducing the number of directors and changing voting procedures. Some
investors saw this as a positive step toward improved corporate
governance, while others expressed concerns about reducing independent
oversight. The impact on THE COMPANY’s stock was initially neutral to
slightly negative.</p>
<p><strong>Vehicle Fire Incident in China</strong> A viral video showed
a parked vehicle from THE COMPANY spontaneously combusting in China.
This incident triggered strong reactions from Chinese consumers and
raised concerns about vehicle safety, particularly in a key market where
THE COMPANY is trying to expand. The news contributed to a stock decline
and added pressure on its reputation.</p>
<p><strong>Autonomous Driving &amp; Robotaxi Claims</strong> THE CEO
made bold claims about launching fully autonomous taxis by next year,
stating that owning any other vehicle would soon be "financially
insane." While some analysts acknowledged THE COMPANY’s leadership in
electric vehicles, others viewed the announcement as an attempt to
distract from operational challenges. Investors were skeptical, and the
stock reaction remained muted.</p>
<p><strong>Disappointing Earnings Report</strong> THE COMPANY reported
worse-than-expected financial results, missing both revenue and earnings
estimates. Vehicle deliveries declined, cash reserves fell, and the
outlook for profitability weakened. Analysts downgraded the stock,
citing concerns over demand, production efficiency, and capital
requirements. The stock dropped following the earnings release.</p>
<p><strong>Capital Raise Speculation</strong> Following the earnings
report, analysts predicted that THE COMPANY would need to raise
additional funds to sustain operations and growth. THE CEO initially
resisted the idea but later acknowledged its potential necessity. This
uncertainty around financing created volatility in the stock and raised
concerns about long-term financial stability.</p>

<h2 class="unnumbered" id="llms-strategy">LLMs’ Strategy</h2>
<p>The traded instrument was TSLA, with the trading period set between
2019-05-05 and 2019-06-02.</p>
<p><strong>LLMs’ decision: <em>SHORT</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>Rationale</strong>: The analysis suggests a SHORT position
due to several concerning factors. Firstly, the company’s fundamental
metrics are weak, with negative EPS YoY (-46.43%), Free Cash Flow YoY
(-183.06%), and Net Income YoY (-75.37%). These figures indicate
declining profitability and cash flow issues, which undermine confidence
in future earnings growth.</p>
<p>Secondly, the technical indicators reveal bearish signals: the stock
is currently trading below its 50MA (19.52) and 200MA (20.89),
suggesting that momentum is shifting downward. The MACD shows a bearish
strength (-0.286) while RSI sits at 51, indicating neutral but potential
weakness ahead.</p>
<p>Furthermore, news factors highlight significant risks: analysts have
downgraded the stock rating from Outperform to Peer Perform due to
concerns over demand for its flagship product—an indication of weakening
consumer interest amidst increasing competition in the electric vehicle
market.</p>
<p><strong>Top weighted features influencing this decision</strong>:</p>
<p>Stock_Data.Price.Close (19.06)</p>
<p>Technical_Analysis.MACD.Value (-0.286)</p>
<p>Fundamental_Data.Growth_Metrics.EPS_YoY (-46%)</p>
<p>Fundamental_Data.Growth_Metrics.Free_Cash_Flow_YoY (-183%)</p>
<p>Options_Data.Put_IV_Skews.Otm_Skew (1.05)</p>
<p><strong>Key news impacting this strategy</strong>:</p>
<p>Analysts’ downgrade on performance - Market Impact Score: 5/5</p>
<p>CEO’s share purchase showing confidence amid uncertainties - Market
Impact Score: 4/5</p>
<p>Fatal crash raising safety concerns leading to regulatory scrutiny -

News</h2>
<p><strong>Increased Regulatory Scrutiny on Tech Companies</strong> Amid
growing concerns over data privacy and antitrust regulations, government
agencies are considering imposing stricter oversight on major tech
firms, including THE COMPANY. Analysts speculate that potential legal
battles or regulatory fines could impact THE COMPANY’s ability to
innovate freely and expand its services sector.</p>
<p><strong>Supply Chain Disruptions Affecting Production</strong> Recent
reports highlight supply chain constraints affecting key components in
THE COMPANY’s flagship product. Delays in procurement and rising
material costs have forced THE COMPANY to adjust production schedules,
raising concerns about meeting consumer demand in the upcoming
quarters.</p>
<p><strong>Expansion of THE COMPANY’s Services Sector</strong> THE
COMPANY is accelerating its push into subscription-based services,
introducing new offerings aimed at diversifying revenue streams beyond
hardware sales. Analysts view this as a strategic move to reduce
dependency on product cycles and strengthen long-term financial
stability.</p>
<p><strong>Legal Dispute Over Intellectual Property</strong> A recent
legal battle involving THE COMPANY and a competitor over key patents in
software and hardware integration has escalated. While THE COMPANY
asserts its technology leadership, potential litigation outcomes could
impact future product developments and licensing agreements.</p>
<p><strong>Market Reaction to Economic Indicators</strong> Recent
economic data, including consumer spending trends and inflation reports,
have influenced investor sentiment toward THE COMPANY. Market analysts
are closely watching how macroeconomic conditions will affect THE
COMPANY’s pricing strategy and global sales performance.</p>

<p>The traded instrument was AAPL, with the trading period set between
2019-04-07 and 2019-05-05.</p>
<p><strong>LLMs’ decision: <em>LONG</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>Rationale</strong>: The analysis indicates a bullish strategy
for the next month based on several compelling factors. First, the
stock’s current close price of 44.05 is above both its 20MA (42.11) and
50MA (42.86), suggesting upward momentum (Feature:
Stock_Data.Price.Close). Second, with an RSI value of 58.26, it
indicates that the stock is not overbought yet and may have room to run
higher before reaching overbought conditions (Feature:

indicated by a historical volatility of approximately 27.78%, the
implied volatility at around 22.63% suggests that options are priced
favorably for potential upside moves (Feature:
Implied_Volatility.IV_Close). Fourth, fundamental growth metrics such as
EPS YoY at approximately 28% signal strong earnings potential which
supports price appreciation (Feature:
Fundamental_Data.Growth_Metrics.EPS_YoY). Lastly, news analysis reveals
positive sentiment from market analysts regarding improved production
capabilities; this aligns with pricing trends and reinforces confidence
in future profitability due to reduced dependence on external
suppliers.</p>

<p><strong>Regulatory Scrutiny on Data Privacy</strong> THE COMPANY is
facing increased regulatory attention over data privacy concerns.
Lawmakers are considering stricter policies that could impact THE
COMPANY’s advertising and services revenue. Investors are closely
watching potential changes that might affect business operations and
user engagement.</p>
<p><strong>Supply Chain Disruptions and Production Adjustments</strong>
Reports indicate that THE COMPANY is experiencing supply chain
constraints, leading to adjustments in production targets. While THE
COMPANY is working to mitigate these issues through alternative sourcing
strategies, analysts are concerned about potential delays in delivering
key products to market.</p>
<p><strong>Expansion into Subscription-Based Services</strong> THE
COMPANY is accelerating its transition into subscription-based services,
introducing new offerings that aim to reduce dependence on hardware
sales. Analysts view this as a strategic move that could provide more
consistent revenue streams amid fluctuating device sales.</p>
<p><strong>Legal Disputes Over Patents and Licensing</strong> A legal
dispute has emerged between THE COMPANY and a competitor over
intellectual property related to software and hardware integration. The
outcome of this case could have long-term implications for THE COMPANY’s

<p><strong>NEXT PAGE</strong>: Model’s Decision and Rationale.</p>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="llms-strategy-2">LLMs’ Strategy</h2>
<p>The traded instrument was GOOGL, with the trading period set between
2019-11-04 and 2019-12-02.</p>
<p><strong>LLMs’ decision: <em>LONG</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>Rationale</strong>: The current analysis indicates a positive
outlook for the stock based on several key factors. Firstly, the stock
is trading above its 20-day moving average (61.15) and shows strong
weekly past returns (1.66%, 1.23%, 2.19%, 0.24%), suggesting bullish
momentum despite recent price dips below the MA levels, particularly
influenced by external competition pressures.</p>
<p>Secondly, while the RSI value is at 39.67 indicating it’s approaching
oversold territory, this suggests potential for a rebound which aligns
with recent analyst upgrades and positive earnings projections that hint
at strong future demand in an evolving EV market.</p>
<p>Thirdly, macroeconomic indicators such as GDP growth (0.0099) and PMI
(51.1), along with declining Treasury yields (-0.457), suggest a risk-on
environment favorable for high-growth tech stocks like ours.</p>
<p>Fourthly, news factors also play a crucial role: "Analysts predict
significant rebounds in deliveries," score of **4 out of 5**; "Strategic
collaboration expected to enhance product offerings," score of **5 out
of 5**; and "Analyst upgrades suggest bullish outlook," score of **4 out
of 5**, all indicate strong market confidence.</p>
<p>Lastly, considering the implied volatility skews are stable relative
to historical volatility levels supports taking on positions
anticipating upward movement as investor sentiment improves
post-competition announcements.</p>

<p><strong>Retail Sector Volatility and THE COMPANY’s Market
Position</strong> Amid ongoing shifts in the retail landscape, THE
COMPANY has faced increasing competitive pressure from digital
retailers, leading to significant fluctuations in stock performance.
Recent industry-wide movements have shown that investors are using THE
COMPANY as a key indicator for traditional retail stability. Analysts
suggest that continued adaptation to e-commerce trends will be crucial
for THE COMPANY’s future growth.</p>
<p><strong>Strategic Expansion into Direct-to-Consumer Sales</strong>
THE COMPANY has strengthened its focus on direct-to-consumer sales,
enhancing its online platform and reducing reliance on third-party
distribution. This shift has resulted in improved margins and greater
control over customer engagement. Analysts believe that this strategy
could protect THE COMPANY from broader market shifts while ensuring
sustained revenue growth.</p>
<p><strong>Executive Leadership Changes and Market Reactions</strong>
THE COMPANY announced key executive leadership changes, appointing a new
senior figure to lead innovation and digital transformation efforts. The
market reacted positively to the appointment, with investors expressing
confidence in the company’s renewed focus on operational efficiency and
strategic growth.</p>
<p><strong>Increased Competition in Key Market Segments</strong> Recent
reports indicate that THE COMPANY is facing heightened competition in
one of its core market segments, with rival firms aggressively expanding
their offerings. Analysts predict that maintaining brand strength and
customer loyalty will be critical to counteracting these competitive
threats.</p>
<p><strong>Analyst Upgrades Amid Optimistic Growth Projections</strong>
Several analysts have revised their outlook on THE COMPANY, citing
improvements in product innovation, operational efficiency, and supply
chain management. The stock price saw an upward movement following the
revised projections, reflecting renewed investor confidence in the
company’s long-term strategy.</p>

<p>The traded instrument was AMZN, with the trading period set between
2018-09-03 and 2019-10-01.</p>
<p><strong>LLMs’ decision: <em>LONG</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>Rationale</strong>: The analysis supports a LONG position
based on several compelling indicators. Firstly, the stock is currently
trading above its 20MA (90.00) and 50MA (86.47), signaling positive
momentum with a recent close at 91.72, indicating strength in price
action. Secondly, the RSI value of 60.43 suggests that while the stock
is not overbought yet, it is trending positively which could indicate
further upside potential.</p>
<p>Thirdly, despite some mixed analyst views regarding valuation and
short-term volatility due to trade tensions and tariffs, there are also
positive indicators such as analyst upgrades for THE COMPANY’s stock
target suggesting expected growth, which impacts sentiment
positively.</p>
<p>From a fundamental perspective, EPS YoY growth of approximately 8.67%
indicates solid profitability trends, even though free cash flow has
seen negative movement (-5.60%), showing resilience in earnings
generation under pressure.</p>
<p>Lastly, macro data showing SPX closing slope <span
class="math inline">&gt;</span> 0 and VIX slope <span
class="math inline">&lt;</span> 0 indicate bullish market sentiment
overall, further reinforcing our decision.</p>

News</h2>
<p><strong>Unusual Options Activity and Market Speculation</strong>

COMPANY, with heavy call buying activity ahead of an earnings report.

areas. Investor sentiment was cautiously optimistic, with market
analysts viewing the expansion as a sign of long-term strategic
planning.</p>
<p><strong>Earnings Beat and Strong Market Reaction</strong> THE COMPANY

<h2 class="unnumbered" id="llms-strategy-5">LLMs’ Strategy</h2>
<p>The traded instrument was MSFT, with the trading period set between
2015-11-02 and 2015-11-30.</p>
<p><strong>LLMs’ decision: <em>LONG</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>Rationale</strong>: The decision to take a LONG position is
supported by multiple key factors. Firstly, THE COMPANY’s stock is
trading at $45.57, above both the 20-day moving average (43.81) and the
50-day moving average (44.74), indicating strong bullish momentum. While
historical volatility is relatively high (40%), the implied volatility
(27%) suggests that market sentiment remains stable, providing an
opportunity for controlled risk.</p>
<p>Secondly, technical indicators such as RSI at 60.18 suggest further
upside potential before overbought conditions set in. Fundamentally,
despite a decline in EPS YoY (-12.68%), free cash flow growth of 28.99%
highlights strong liquidity and operational efficiency, reinforcing the
bullish case.</p>
<p>Macroeconomic conditions also favor a long position, with GDP QoQ at
0.18% and declining market volatility (VIX down 7%), indicating a
risk-on sentiment. The broader market (SPX) is also in an upward trend
(+1%), adding further confidence in equities.</p>

if it meets estimates - Market Impact Score: 4/5</p>

<p><strong>Strong Financial Performance &amp; Earnings Beat</strong> THE
COMPANY reported a significant earnings beat, posting revenue and profit
figures well above analysts’ expectations. The surprise profitability
fueled a sharp increase in THE COMPANY’s stock price, surging over 10%
in after-hours trading. Investors reacted positively to the strong
growth across multiple segments, particularly in cloud services and
digital media.</p>
<p><strong>Work Culture Controversy &amp; Public Backlash</strong> A
major publication released an investigative report criticizing THE
COMPANY’s workplace culture, citing allegations of excessive pressure,
harsh management practices, and unfair treatment of employees. THE
COMPANY’s top executives, including THE VP, issued a strong rebuttal,
claiming the report was misleading and lacked journalistic standards.
While the news initially weighed on investor sentiment, the company’s
stock remained resilient amid continued business growth.</p>
<p><strong>Expansion in Logistics &amp; Delivery Services</strong> THE
COMPANY announced the expansion of its same-day delivery service to
multiple metropolitan areas, increasing its footprint in the logistics
space. The move was seen as a direct challenge to traditional courier
services and positioned THE COMPANY as a dominant force in e-commerce
fulfillment. Analysts viewed the expansion favorably, citing enhanced
customer experience and potential cost efficiencies.</p>
<p><strong>Major Hiring Initiative for Seasonal Workforce</strong> Ahead
of the holiday season, THE COMPANY revealed plans to hire over 100,000
temporary workers to meet rising demand. The announcement signaled
confidence in consumer spending and THE COMPANY’s ability to handle peak
shopping periods. Market reaction was positive, with analysts expecting
a strong quarter driven by increased retail sales.</p>
<p><strong>Regulatory Scrutiny Over Tax Practices</strong> THE COMPANY
faced renewed scrutiny from regulatory bodies regarding its tax
structure and alleged use of offshore subsidiaries to minimize tax
obligations. While no immediate penalties were imposed, the heightened
regulatory attention created some uncertainty for investors. However,
the stock showed limited reaction as the broader market remained focused
on the company’s robust growth prospects.</p>

recent weeks, suggesting positive market interest and possible trend
sustainability.</p>

<p><strong>Increased Competition in the Industry</strong> A major

confident in THE COMPANY’s ability to maintain its lead, while others
expressed caution.</p>
<p><strong>Speculation on Strategic Partnerships and Buyouts</strong>
Rumors emerged regarding a potential acquisition involving THE COMPANY,
sparking volatility in its stock price. While no official confirmation

<p><strong>NEXT PAGE</strong>: Model’s Decision and Rationale.</p>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="llms-strategy-8">LLMs’ Strategy</h2>
<p>The traded instrument was AAPL, with the trading period set in
between 2015-01-05 and 2015-02-02.</p>
<p><strong>LLMs’ decision: <em>LONG</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>Rationale</strong>: The decision to go LONG is supported by
several compelling factors. Firstly, the stock’s price at $28.66 is
above both the 20MA ($28.41) and 50MA ($26.63), indicating strong
bullish momentum and a positive trend in price action. Additionally, the
RSI at 58 suggests that while not overbought, there is room for further
upward movement without immediate correction risk.</p>
<p>Moreover, recent news highlights record quarterly revenue growth of
$74.6 billion exceeding analyst expectations, which enhances investor
confidence and positions the company favorably in the market (Market
Impact Score: 5). The analysts’ upgrades to their price targets
reinforce this sentiment (Market Impact Score: 4). Furthermore, strong
sales growth of 70% in China indicates robust demand and a significant
opportunity for future revenue increases.</p>
<p>From a technical perspective, despite some concerns about smartphone
sales slowing down, overall growth metrics such as EPS YoY at
approximately 48%, Free Cash Flow YoY at around 58%, alongside healthy
margins (Gross Margin:  39%, Net Profit Margin:  24%), indicate solid
profitability and sustainability.</p>
<p>Additionally, macroeconomic indicators show positive trends with GDP
QoQ up and PMI above neutral (53.7), suggesting economic expansion which
typically supports equity performance.</p>

<h2 class="unnumbered" id="llms-strategy-9">LLMs’ Strategy</h2>
<p>The traded instrument was META, with the trading period set between
2016-01-04 and 2016-02-01.</p>
<p><strong>LLMs’ decision: <em>SHORT</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>Rationale</strong>: The stock exhibits several red flags
indicating a potential decline. Firstly, the negative EBIT Margin
(-0.1333) and Negative Net Profit Margin (-0.1278) suggest that the
company is currently operating at a loss, which can deter investors and
decrease demand for shares.</p>
<p>Additionally, the Current Ratio (0.1962) and Quick Ratio (0.0)
indicate severe liquidity issues, implying that the company may struggle
to cover its short-term liabilities, further increasing financial
risk.</p>
<p>From a technical perspective, both RSI values (35.94), which is below
40 suggests weak momentum while MACD shows bearish signals with a drop
in strength over recent periods (-0.0248). The stock price has also been
trading well below its moving averages: 20MA (approx 269), 50MA (approx
334), suggesting downward pressure on price action.</p>
<p>Given these factors coupled with high volatility indicated by ATR of
approximately 0.0225 points towards potential price swings unfavorable
to long positions; thus establishing a short position could be
beneficial in capturing downside movement over the next month.</p>
