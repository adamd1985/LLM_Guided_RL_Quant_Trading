\section{Introduction}

This document outlines a structured methodology for expert reviewers to evaluate trade strategies generated by Large Language Models (LLMs). The evaluation framework is based on principles from Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) \citep{Retzlaff2024HumanintheLoopRL} and Human-AI Teaming \citep{vats2024surveyhumanaiteaminglarge, xie2024text2rewardrewardshapinglanguage}.

The goal is to assess whether AI-generated strategies are logical, aligned with what portfolio managers would do, and safe for real-world application. The expert’s role is to score, annotate, and, where possible, provide exemplar corrections.

The findings from this evaluation will contribute to the paper: "Language Model Guided Reinforcement Learning in Quantitative Trading." Reviewers will be acknowledged for their contributions, and the results will be shared.

\section{Review Instructions}

\subsection{Step 1: Problem Definition}

You will be provided with one year of historical market data, the data is anonymized to prevent bias due to prior knowledge of the financial instrument:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Price and volatility trends (e.g. Weekly Close, Otions IV, Moving Averages),
    \item Fundamental indicators (e.g., Cash Flow, P/E ratio),
    \item Economic indicators (e.g., Consumer Confidence, PPI),
    \item Anonymized news summaries related to the trading instrument.
\end{enumerate}

Your first task is to analyze the given information and determine the likely optimal trading action: \textit{LONG} (buy) or \textit{SHORT} (sell) with a brief justification (one or two sentences) for your chosen position.

\subsection{Step 2: Expert Scoring}

Next, you will evaluate the LLM-generated trade strategy by analyzing its decision \textit{rationale} \citep{vats2024surveyhumanaiteaminglarge} and \textit{selection of key influencing factors} \citep{wang2024llmfactorextractingprofitablefactors}. The scores are defined in the rubric below, inspired by Explainable AI (XAI) metrics \citet{Demajo_2020, xai_Khawaga_2023}:

\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1.2} % Increase row spacing for readability
\begin{tabular}{p{2.55cm} p{4.25cm} p{4.25cm} p{4.25cm}} % Adjust column widths
\toprule
\textbf{Criterion} & \textbf{Score -1 (Poor)} & \textbf{Score 0 (Average)} & \textbf{Score 1 (Good)} \\
\midrule
\textbf{Rationale} & Contradicting and/or with logical errors. & Mostly coherent, with some gaps. & Logical and valid reasoning. \\
\textbf{Fidelity} & Not applicable to real-world markets. & Somewhat applicable, but unrealistic. & Performs like a trained professional. \\
\textbf{Safety} & Ignored the risks. & Recognized the risks but did not act. & Recognized and mitigated the risks. \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\caption{Scoring rubric for expert evaluations.}
\label{tab:scoring}
\end{table}


\subsection{Step 3: Expert Exemplars}

After scoring the AI's decision, and if applicable, you are requested to provide specific feedback on errors in the form of corrective explanations \citep{xie2024text2rewardrewardshapinglanguage}. You can skip this if the model was perfect, or there is no root cause in the historic market data for causing the model to fail (e.g. a black swan event).

\textbf{Guidelines for Expert Feedback:}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Identify where the AI's decision deviates from sound trading principles.
    \item Provide a corrected response that aligns with best market practices.
\end{enumerate}

An example of a corrective explanation:
\begin{quote}
    \textbf{LLM's Explanation:} "Degrading fundamentals on TSLA, with a decrease in consumer confidence, suggest a \textit{SHORT} position." \\
    \textbf{Expert's Explanation:} The high ATR range of TSLA, coupled with an increase in implied volatility (IV) on call options, and the CEO’s optimistic guidance in a recent interview, indicates a potential \textit{LONG} setup despite the market downturn.
\end{quote}

\subsection{Step 4: Iterative Refinement}

The feedback, scores, and exemplars provided by experts will be collected to refine and improve the AI’s decision-making process similar to Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) \cite{Retzlaff2024HumanintheLoopRL, Pternea_2024}.

\subsection*{Historic 1 Month News}

\textbf{Board Restructuring \& Corporate Governance Changes}
THE COMPANY announced plans to streamline its board by reducing the number of directors and changing voting procedures. Some investors saw this as a positive step toward improved corporate governance, while others expressed concerns about reducing independent oversight. The impact on THE COMPANY's stock was initially neutral to slightly negative.

\textbf{Vehicle Fire Incident in China}
A viral video showed a parked vehicle from THE COMPANY spontaneously combusting in China. This incident triggered strong reactions from Chinese consumers and raised concerns about vehicle safety, particularly in a key market where THE COMPANY is trying to expand. The news contributed to a stock decline and added pressure on its reputation.

\textbf{Autonomous Driving \& Robotaxi Claims}
THE CEO made bold claims about launching fully autonomous taxis by next year, stating that owning any other vehicle would soon be "financially insane." While some analysts acknowledged THE COMPANY's leadership in electric vehicles, others viewed the announcement as an attempt to distract from operational challenges. Investors were skeptical, and the stock reaction remained muted.

\textbf{Disappointing Earnings Report}
THE COMPANY reported worse-than-expected financial results, missing both revenue and earnings estimates. Vehicle deliveries declined, cash reserves fell, and the outlook for profitability weakened. Analysts downgraded the stock, citing concerns over demand, production efficiency, and capital requirements. The stock dropped following the earnings release.

\textbf{Capital Raise Speculation}
Following the earnings report, analysts predicted that THE COMPANY would need to raise additional funds to sustain operations and growth. THE CEO initially resisted the idea but later acknowledged its potential necessity. This uncertainty around financing created volatility in the stock and raised concerns about long-term financial stability.

\subsection*{LLMs' Strategy}

The traded instrument was TSLA, with the trading period set between 2019-05-05 and 2019-06-02.

\textbf{LLMs' decision: \textit{SHORT}}

\textbf{Rationale}: The analysis suggests a SHORT position due to several concerning factors. Firstly, the company's fundamental metrics are weak, with negative EPS YoY (-46.43\%), Free Cash Flow YoY (-183.06\%), and Net Income YoY (-75.37\%). These figures indicate declining profitability and cash flow issues, which undermine confidence in future earnings growth.

Secondly, the technical indicators reveal bearish signals: the stock is currently trading below its 50MA (19.52) and 200MA (20.89), suggesting that momentum is shifting downward. The MACD shows a bearish strength (-0.286) while RSI sits at 51, indicating neutral but potential weakness ahead.

Furthermore, news factors highlight significant risks: analysts have downgraded the stock rating from Outperform to Peer Perform due to concerns over demand for its flagship product—an indication of weakening consumer interest amidst increasing competition in the electric vehicle market.

\textbf{Top weighted features influencing this decision}:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Stock\_Data.Price.Close (19.06)
    \item Technical\_Analysis.MACD.Value (-0.286)
    \item Fundamental\_Data.Growth\_Metrics.EPS\_YoY (-46\%)
    \item Fundamental\_Data.Growth\_Metrics.Free\_Cash\_Flow\_YoY (-183\%)
    \item Options\_Data.Put\_IV\_Skews.Otm\_Skew (1.05)
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Key news impacting this strategy}:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Analysts’ downgrade on performance - Market Impact Score: 5/5
    \item CEO’s share purchase showing confidence amid uncertainties - Market Impact Score: 4/5
    \item Fatal crash raising safety concerns leading to regulatory scrutiny - Market Impact Score: 4/5

\subsection*{LLMs' Strategy}

The traded instrument was AAPL, with the trading period set between 2019-04-07 and 2019-05-05.

\textbf{LLMs' decision: \textit{LONG}}

\textbf{Rationale}: The analysis indicates a bullish strategy for the next month based on several compelling factors. First, the stock's current close price of 44.05 is above both its 20MA (42.11) and 50MA (42.86), suggesting upward momentum (Feature: Stock\_Data.Price.Close). Second, with an RSI value of 58.26, it indicates that the stock is not overbought yet and may have room to run higher before reaching overbought conditions (Feature: Technical\_Analysis.RSI.Value). Third, despite recent volatility indicated by a historical volatility of approximately 27.78\%, the implied volatility at around 22.63\% suggests that options are priced favorably for potential upside moves (Feature: Implied\_Volatility.IV\_Close). Fourth, fundamental growth metrics such as EPS YoY at approximately 28\% signal strong earnings potential which supports price appreciation (Feature: Fundamental\_Data.Growth\_Metrics.EPS\_YoY). Lastly, news analysis reveals positive sentiment from market analysts regarding improved production capabilities; this aligns with pricing trends and reinforces confidence in future profitability due to reduced dependence on external suppliers.

\textbf{Top weighted features influencing this decision}:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Stock\_Data.Price.Close (44.05)
    \item Technical\_Analysis.RSI.Value (58.26)
    \item Implied\_Volatility.IV\_Close (22.63\%)
    \item Fundamental\_Data.Growth\_Metrics.EPS\_YoY (28\%)
    \item Historical\_Volatility (27.78\%)
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Key news impacting this strategy}:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Market analysts upgraded ratings on THE COMPANY due to improved production capabilities - Market Impact Score: 4/5
    \item The strategic shift to self-manufactured chips potentially enhancing profit margins - Market Impact Score: 4/5
    \item Mixed sentiments about production targets indicating cautious optimism but manageable risk - Market Impact Score: 3/5

\subsection*{LLMs' Strategy}

The traded instrument was GOOGL, with the trading period set between 2019-11-04 and 2019-12-02.

\textbf{LLMs' decision: \textit{LONG}}

\textbf{Rationale}: The current analysis indicates a positive outlook for the stock based on several key factors. Firstly, the stock is trading above its 20-day moving average (61.15) and shows strong weekly past returns (1.66\%, 1.23\%, 2.19\%, 0.24\%), suggesting bullish momentum despite recent price dips below the MA levels, particularly influenced by external competition pressures.

Secondly, while the RSI value is at 39.67 indicating it's approaching oversold territory, this suggests potential for a rebound which aligns with recent analyst upgrades and positive earnings projections that hint at strong future demand in an evolving EV market.

Thirdly, macroeconomic indicators such as GDP growth (0.0099) and PMI (51.1), along with declining Treasury yields (-0.457), suggest a risk-on environment favorable for high-growth tech stocks like ours.

Fourthly, news factors also play a crucial role: "Analysts predict significant rebounds in deliveries," score of **4 out of 5**; "Strategic collaboration expected to enhance product offerings," score of **5 out of 5**; and "Analyst upgrades suggest bullish outlook," score of **4 out of 5**, all indicate strong market confidence.

Lastly, considering the implied volatility skews are stable relative to historical volatility levels supports taking on positions anticipating upward movement as investor sentiment improves post-competition announcements.

Firstly, the stock is currently trading above its 20MA (90.00) and 50MA (86.47), signaling positive momentum with a recent close at 91.72, indicating strength in price action. Secondly, the RSI value of 60.43 suggests that while the stock is not overbought yet, it is trending positively which could indicate further upside potential.

Thirdly, despite some mixed analyst views regarding valuation and short-term volatility due to trade tensions and tariffs, there are also positive indicators such as analyst upgrades for THE COMPANY’s stock target suggesting expected growth, which impacts sentiment positively.

From a fundamental perspective, EPS YoY growth of approximately 8.67\% indicates solid profitability trends, even though free cash flow has seen negative movement (-5.60\%), showing resilience in earnings generation under pressure.

\subsection*{LLMs' Strategy}

The traded instrument was MSFT, with the trading period set between 2015-11-02 and 2015-11-30.

\textbf{LLMs' decision: \textit{LONG}}

\textbf{Rationale}: The decision to take a LONG position is supported by multiple key factors. Firstly, THE COMPANY's stock is trading at \$45.57, above both the 20-day moving average (43.81) and the 50-day moving average (44.74), indicating strong bullish momentum. While historical volatility is relatively high (40\%), the implied volatility (27\%) suggests that market sentiment remains stable, providing an opportunity for controlled risk.

Secondly, technical indicators such as RSI at 60.18 suggest further upside potential before overbought conditions set in. Fundamentally, despite a decline in EPS YoY (-12.68\%), free cash flow growth of 28.99\% highlights strong liquidity and operational efficiency, reinforcing the bullish case.

Macroeconomic conditions also favor a long position, with GDP QoQ at 0.18\% and declining market volatility (VIX down 7\%), indicating a risk-on sentiment. The broader market (SPX) is also in an upward trend (+1\%), adding further confidence in equities.

\subsection*{LLMs' Strategy}

The traded instrument was AAPL, with the trading period set in between 2015-01-05 and 2015-02-02.

\textbf{LLMs' decision: \textit{LONG}}

\textbf{Rationale}: The decision to go LONG is supported by several compelling factors. Firstly, the stock's price at \$28.66 is above both the 20MA (\$28.41) and 50MA (\$26.63), indicating strong bullish momentum and a positive trend in price action. Additionally, the RSI at 58 suggests that while not overbought, there is room for further upward movement without immediate correction risk.

Moreover, recent news highlights record quarterly revenue growth of \$74.6 billion exceeding analyst expectations, which enhances investor confidence and positions the company favorably in the market (Market Impact Score: 5). The analysts' upgrades to their price targets reinforce this sentiment (Market Impact Score: 4). Furthermore, strong sales growth of 70\% in China indicates robust demand and a significant opportunity for future revenue increases.

From a technical perspective, despite some concerns about smartphone sales slowing down, overall growth metrics such as EPS YoY at approximately 48\%, Free Cash Flow YoY at around 58\%, alongside healthy margins (Gross Margin: ~39\%, Net Profit Margin: ~24\%), indicate solid profitability and sustainability.

Additionally, macroeconomic indicators show positive trends with GDP QoQ up and PMI above neutral (53.7), suggesting economic expansion which typically supports equity performance.

\textbf{Top weighted features influencing this decision}:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Stock\_Data.Price.Close (28.66)
    \item Technical\_Analysis.20MA (28.41)
    \item Technical\_Analysis.50MA (26.63)
    \item Fundamental\_Data.Growth\_Metrics.EPS\_YoY (48\%)
    \item Fundamental\_Data.Growth\_Metrics.Free\_Cash\_Flow\_YoY (58\%)
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Key news impacting this strategy}:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Record quarterly revenue of \$74.6 billion - Market Impact Score: 5/5
    \item Analysts raised price targets following strong earnings - Market Impact Score: 4/5
    \item Anticipated launch of Apple Watch as new revenue stream - Market Impact Score: 4/5
    \item Strong revenue growth in China (70\%) - Market Impact Score: 4/5

\subsection*{LLMs' Strategy}

The traded instrument was META, with the trading period set between 2016-01-04 and 2016-02-01.

\textbf{LLMs' decision: \textit{SHORT}}

\textbf{Rationale}: The stock exhibits several red flags indicating a potential decline. Firstly, the negative EBIT Margin (-0.1333) and Negative Net Profit Margin (-0.1278) suggest that the company is currently operating at a loss, which can deter investors and decrease demand for shares.

Additionally, the Current Ratio (0.1962) and Quick Ratio (0.0) indicate severe liquidity issues, implying that the company may struggle to cover its short-term liabilities, further increasing financial risk.

From a technical perspective, both RSI values (35.94), which is below 40 suggests weak momentum while MACD shows bearish signals with a drop in strength over recent periods (-0.0248). The stock price has also been trading well below its moving averages: 20MA (approx 269), 50MA (approx 334), suggesting downward pressure on price action.

Given these factors coupled with high volatility indicated by ATR of approximately 0.0225 points towards potential price swings unfavorable to long positions; thus establishing a short position could be beneficial in capturing downside movement over the next month.
